In 1986 BJS looked more generally at criminal defense with the Criminal Defense System Study, and targeted studies at public defense with the National Survey of Indigent Defense Systems (NSIDS) as a probability sample in 1999 and a census in 2013. In response to lessons learned from the 1999 NSIDS, BJS also conducted the Census of Public Defender Offices (CPDO) in 2007, focusing on publicly-funded defender offices. Each of BJS’s prior collections examined public defense at the office level. After consideration of the results of these efforts, BJS determined that some questions about the provision of public defense. In 2021, the SPD survey instrument and sample design were created and pilot tested.

In Lake Okeechobee, this need is especially important due to its relatively shallow depth, which creates unique thermal and ecological dynamics that differ substantially from those observed in deeper lakes. These site-specific differences may influence bloom frequency, intensity, and duration, making detailed, sustained monitoring a critical step toward understanding HAB behavior in this system.</p><p>	To address this need, the proposed work will involve several months of intensive water quality data collection in and/or near Lake Okeechobee, extending through the bloom season and including approximately 30 days before and after to capture rapid seasonal transitions.

The newly collected data from Lake Okeechobee will be compared to historical datasets from Clinton Lake in Lawrence, KS, enabling a comparative analysis of HAB triggers across two distinct lake environments.

In many cases, monitoring invasive species dynamics is not sufficient because control or management actions are implemented based on economic or ecological impacts. Monitoring invasive species involves tracking their dynamics and assessing their economic and ecological impacts. Therefore, monitoring data is not optimized to inform the outcomes of invasive species control or other management actions, thereby limiting the decision relevance of monitoring efforts and precluding the development of formalizing learning. Learning can be formalized using analytical approaches, such as Bayesian belief networks, to employ iterative updating (i.e., Bayesian learning) and monitor data to inform the iterative application of invasive species control or management actions, thereby meeting natural resource agency management objectives. Integrating monitoring of invasive species dynamics with monitoring of concurrent economic and ecological impacts is required to maximize the return on monitoring investment and maximize the value of monitoring data for iterative learning, which in turn is needed to maximize the effectiveness of control or management actions.This project will fill a knowledge gap in efficient, effective, and economic monitoring approaches, with an emphasis on informing the effectiveness of management actions intended to control invasive species and minimize economic impacts in the Mississippi River Basin. Specifically, once an invasive species invades an aquatic system, existing monitoring continues to follow established protocols that are suboptimal in informing the effectiveness of management actions. Developing frameworks that iteratively update from accumulated monitoring efforts can adapt to what is learned, maximizing the return on investment in evaluating the effectiveness of management actions intended to control invasive aquatic species.

Through an agreement with philanthropic partners, including the Walton Family Foundation (WFF), CAMEL consists of two phases. Phase I invites proposals for the creation of new research networks to support the generation of high value datasets that aim to advance math learning and education. These research networks must include researchers who study the basic science of learning, education practitioners, and data scientists. The high value dataset may come from either generating a new dataset or by increasing the value of an existing dataset. Phase II, open only to awardees of Phase I, establishes a &ldquo;collaboratory,&rdquo; which is a socio-technological platform that prioritizes community-building and capacity-building to sustain collaborative efforts to advance math learning and education in K-12.

<p><span style="color: black;">The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Science Mission Directorate (SMD) released its annual omnibus Research Announcement (NRA), Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES) – 2025 (OMB Approval Number 2700-0092, CFDA Number 43.001) on February 21, 2025. In this case "omnibus" means that this NRA has many individual program elements, each with its own due dates and topics. All together these cover the wide range of basic and applied supporting research and technology supported by SMD. </span>Awards will be made as grants, cooperative agreements, or contracts depending on the nature of the work proposed. However, most extramural research awards deriving from ROSES will be grants, and many program elements of ROSES specifically exclude contracts, because contracts would not be appropriate for the nature of the work solicited. Funded Co-Is at government labs will receive inter- or intra-agency transfers<span style="color: black;">. The typical period of performance for an award is three years, but some programs may allow up to five years and others specify shorter periods. In most cases, organizations of every type, Government and private, for profit and not-for-profit, domestic and foreign (with some caveats), may submit proposals without restriction on teaming arrangements.

A total of $1,500,000 is available to conduct site assessments, engineering, design, permitting, and implementation including but not limited to site surveys, drawings, plans, permits, labor, materials, equipment, plantings, invasive species control, etc. Depending on estimated project costs determined during engineering and design, the project acreage will be adjusted to maximize the benefits to the Crane Creek lacustuary area. The long-term maintenance of this site will be the responsibility of the US Fish and Wildife Service (USFWS).       The goal of the Crane Creek Lacustuary Wetland Restoration project is to demonstrate that fish and benthic habitat and populations can be improved in the many drowned river-mouths within the Maumee Area of Concern (AOC). This project will utilize restoration techniques such as submerged barrier bars/shoals and rock/earthen islands with fallen/dead tree installation. These features will allow water to move in and out of the site with seiche and river flows, creating fish and benthic habitat that benefit the natural aquatic environment which in turn will improve the water quality in Lake Erie for the citizens who utilize this resource.       The Crane Creek Lacustuary Wetland Restoration project was conceived by a Team of regionally active habitat restoration experts, based upon their knowledge from other sites around the Great Lakes basin. This Team included restoration implementers and regulatory representatives from USFWS, US Geological Survey (USGS), Ohio Environemental Protection Agency (OEPA), Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR), Great Lakes Commission, Ducks Unlimited, Toledo Metroparks, Partners for Clean Streams, and several consulting firms. This project will be modeled after similar projects in the area including the Penn 7 Wetland Restoration project and the Maumee River Islands projects, as well as other successful projects in the Muskegon River and Detroit River AOCs.        The Crane Creek – Frontal Lake Erie Hydrologic Unit (HU) contains Crane Creek, which flows northeast from near Dowling (Ohio), and is subsequently joined by Henry Creek, Little Crane Creek, Ayers Creek, and other unnamed tributaries before flowing through the ONWR into Lake Erie. The lower 5.9 miles of Crane Creek is a lake-influenced, lacustuary zone. The portion of Crane Creek within the ONWR includes over 300 acres of wetlands and is within the lacustuary zone, and as such, lake seiche effects push Lake Erie water both upstream and downstream within the ONWR. The proposed project is located between 1.5 and 2.5 miles upstream from the confluence of Crane Creek with Lake Erie. Almost 75% of the Crane Creek HU is in agricultural production and only 3% is considered impervious surface. Most of the upland areas in this HU are actively farmed, and small channelized ditches carry tile drainage and other agricultural runoff into the larger tributaries and Crane Creek proper.        The impairment of this reach is driven by siltation and high total phosphorus levels because of channelization and runoff from agricultural areas. The lacustuary portion of this HU, is impaired for all 3 biological Beneficial Use Impairments (BUIs), especially the benthos at only 41% of the BUI restoration target. Based on Ohio"s current BUI restoration targets, unless these sites can be improved to over 50% of their targets, the whole HU could remain impaired for benthic community health. Ohio is investigating changing the methods used to measure BUI 6: Degradation of Benthos, but the site is clearly impaired. The fish populations and habitat scores are 86% and 81%, respectively. The lacustuary metric data shows low numbers of total species, a predominance of pollution-tolerant species, heavy siltation, and extensive embeddedness.",NULL,76,1,1500000.00,1.00,1500000.00,"[{"applicant_type_id": 16, "applicant_type_name": "Nonprofits that do not have a 501(c)(3) status with the IRS, other than institutions of higher education"}, {"applicant_type_id": 2, "applicant_type_name": "Nonprofits having a 501(c)(3) status with the IRS, other than institutions of higher education"}, {"applicant_type_id": 15, "applicant_type_name": "Special district governments"}, {"applicant_type_id": 12, "applicant_type_name": "State governments"}, {"applicant_type_id": 14, "applicant_type_name": "Small businesses"}, {"applicant_type_id": 7, "applicant_type_name": "Native American tribal organizations (other than Federally recognized tribal governments)"}, {"applicant_type_id": 6, "applicant_type_name": "City or township governments"}, {"applicant_type_id": 10, "applicant_type_name": "Independent school districts"}, {"applicant_type_id": 4, "applicant_type_name": "Native American tribal governments (Federally recognized)"}, {"applicant_type_id": 3, "applicant_type_name": "County governments"}, {"applicant_type_id": 13, "applicant_type_name": "Public and State controlled institutions of higher education"}, {"applicant_type_id": 17, "applicant_type_name": "Public housing authorities/Indian housing authorities"}, {"applicant_type_id": 11, "applicant_type_name": "Private institutions of higher education"}]"

<p><span style="color: rgb(55, 47, 45);">The operational strain created by the increasing penetration of intermittent renewables has forced thermal units to cycle beyond their designed parameters, accelerating wear and raising the risk of forced outages and blackouts. This reliability emergency coincides with surging demand from national defense installations, semiconductor fabrication, AI data centers, critical mineral processing, and industrial re-shoring, all of which require uninterrupted access to reliable, affordable and secure power.</span></p>

<p><strong>NOTICE: Amended July 15, 2025. ROSES-25 Amendment 1</strong> <strong>announces restrictions on funding of interagency awards from most proposal opportunities in ROSES-25: Appendix A (Earth Science) of ROSES-25 already had a prohibition on funding to government agencies other than NASA. Appendix C, (Planetary Science) has also adopted this prohibition. Appendix B (Heliophysics), Appendix D (Astrophysics), and F.3 The Exoplanet Research Program have not applied an outright prohibition, but require that any proposer planning on funding for or through government agencies other than NASA must seek approval from the point of contact for the program element to which they are planning to propose. D.1 The Astrophysics Research Program Overview notes that approvals for interagency awards for less than $100k per year are unlikely to be granted, regardless of whether the Federal Agency is the submitting institution or a Co-I institution.

Awards will be made as grants, cooperative agreements, or contracts depending on the nature of the work proposed.

To facilitate the support of collaborative work between US researchers and their German counterparts under this MoU, the Division of Chemistry (CHE) and the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental and Transport Systems (CBET) at NSF and the Divisions of Physics and Chemistry (PC) and Engineering Sciences (ING 1) at DFG are pleased to announce a Lead Agency Opportunity for Collaborative Research in Chemistry and Chemical Process and Transport Systems.


The goal of this Lead Agency Opportunity is to reduce barriers to working internationally by allowing US and German researchers to submit a single collaborative proposal that will undergo a single review process while funding organizations maintain budgetary control over their awards. Proposals eligible for funding consideration through this Lead Agency Opportunity should review the CHE, CBET, PC, and ING 1 program descriptions for research supported through these divisions/organizations. Proposals are expected to adhere to typical proposal budgets and durations for the relevant CHE, CBET, PC, and ING 1 programs from which funding is sought.

The program takes a comprehensive approach to the STEM Learning Ecosystem to impact STEM student development and retention.


LSAMP is an alliance-based program, whereby a group of institutions of higher education (IHEs) work together to diversify the nation's science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce by increasing the number of STEM baccalaureate and graduate degrees awarded to persons from LSAMP populations. LSAMP populations are defined as persons from groups underrepresented in the STEM enterprise: Blacks and African-Americans, Hispanic and Latino Americans, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders. The LSAMP program provides funding to alliances that implement comprehensive, evidence-based, innovative, and sustained strategies that ultimately result in the graduation of well-prepared, highly competitive students from LSAMP populations who pursue graduate studies or careers in STEM, while also supporting knowledge generation, knowledge utilization, assessment of program impacts, dissemination activities and dissemination of scholarly research into the field.


Projects supported by the LSAMP program include:


--Alliance Development Grants (ADG) support the conceptualization and development of new B2B and new SPIO alliances. (New)


--Bridge-to-the-Baccalaureate (B2B) alliances facilitate the successful transfer of students from LSAMP populations to four-year institutions in pursuit of STEM baccalaureate degrees.


--STEM Pathways Implementation-Only (SPIO) alliances are designed for new and reconstituted alliances. These projects focus on building and strengthening strategies and approaches to assist Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs) increase STEM baccalaureate degrees to LSAMP populations and facilitate entry into STEM graduate degree programs.


--STEM Pathways Research Alliances (SPRA) are designed for well-established alliances. These projects serve as models of excellence in STEM broadening participation by (1) steadily increasing STEM baccalaureate degrees to LSAMP populations and facilitating entry into STEM graduate degree programs; (2) producing and disseminating new scholarly research on the broadening participation of LSAMP populations (or underrepresented and underserved populations in STEM disciplines and the nation's STEM workforce) and, (3) holistically assess the state of institutionalization and sustainability of the alliance.


--Bridge to STEM Graduate Degrees in National Priorities (BD-Master's) projects support cohorts of six graduate students pursuing a M. S. degree in STEM national priority areas, providing financial support (stipends and cost of education) and support to help develop and maintain academic and research skills that enable participants to successfully persist in STEM graduate degree programs at Master's comprehensive-degree producing institutions only. (New)


--Bridge to STEM Graduate Degrees in National Priorities (BD-Doctoral) projects support cohorts of twelve graduate students pursuing a Ph.D. degree in STEM national priority areas, providing financial support (stipends and cost of education) and support to help develop and maintain academic and research skills that enable participants to successfully persist in STEM doctoral degree programs.


--STEM Networking Incentives and Engagement (NETWORKS) projects provide support to incentivize the creation and participation of LSAMP populations in STEM networks.

CREST-RISE is the component of the CREST program that supports the expansion of institutional research capacity by increasing the strength of institutional graduate programs and the successful production of research doctoral students, especially those from groups underrepresented in STEM.


The CREST-RISE component supports STEM research doctoral programs in all NSF supported areas and encourages proposals in areas of national interest, such as artificial intelligence, data science and analytics; advanced materials, manufacturing, robotics; cybersecurity; plant genetics/agricultural technologies; quantum information sciences; nanotechnology, semiconductors/microelectronics technologies; climate change and clean energy.


CREST-RISE projects must have a direct connection to the long-term plans of the host department(s) and the institution&rsquo;s strategic plan and mission. Project plans should emphasize activities designed to increase the production of research doctoral students, especially those underrepresented in STEM as well as expand institutional research capacity.


The goals of CREST-RISE are to increase: 1) the number of STEM research doctoral programs at MSIs (as defined in the Eligibility section), 2) the number of STEM research doctoral students graduating from MSIs, especially those from groups underrepresented in STEM, and 3) institutional research capacity to increase doctoral students&rsquo; graduation rates.To achieve these goals, the CREST-RISE program includes three tracks as follows:

For the purpose of this program an intelligent engineered system is a human-designed system &mdash; physical, virtual, or a combination of both &mdash; that interacts with its environment to achieve specific goals. These systems collect data, analyze it to make informed decisions, and take actions that enhance safety, efficiency, and well-being. They may operate autonomously or collaboratively with humans, adapting their actions based on the data they collect. A key requirement for the M3X program is that these systems must function within a physics-based environment, whether physical or virtual, where interactions exhibit recognizable physical behaviors, such as those associated with gravity, friction, force, and inertia.


Intelligent engineered systems are becoming increasingly integrated into our daily lives, interacting with humans across diverse environments and through different modalities (for example, visual, haptic, auditory). M3X aims to deepen the understanding of such interactions, particularly in complex and dynamic settings such as elder care, disaster response, and dynamic workplaces. The program encourages explorations into the physical or cognitive principles that enable or constrain human-machine collaboration, advancing foundational theories, interaction modeling, and technological innovations that enhance adaptability, efficiency, and intuitiveness.


Proposals submitted to the M3X program must clearly articulate how the proposed work advances knowledge of bidirectional interactions between humans and intelligent engineered systems. Examples include robots assisting in disaster response, smart environments that learn user preferences, and virtual reality-based rehabilitation technologies that simulate plausible physics.


While proposals are not required to address all aspects of the interaction, they must propose significant contributions to at least one of the following areas:

<ul>
<li>Conceptual Frameworks and Theoretical Modeling<br />Development of new conceptual, mathematical, or computational frameworks that provide structured approaches to understanding and analyzing the bidirectional interaction between humans and engineered systems. These frameworks serve as formalized models or methodologies that guide research in areas such as cognition, perception, and behavior of both humans and intelligent engineered systems during their interactions. Additionally, these computational frameworks facilitate the modeling of safe operating conditions in dynamic task environments and the identification of theoretical limits of cognitive and physical performance capabilities during interaction.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Dynamic Interaction Analysis and Simulation<br />Investigation of emerging and established bidirectional interaction phenomena in physical, virtual, or hybrid environments. Potential topics may include learning, co-adaptation, cooperation, competition, and multi-scale interaction. The program also welcomes novel experimental paradigms to evaluate processes and performance.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Innovative Technologies for Enhanced Interaction<br />Development of methods, tools, and technologies to enable novel or improved forms of bidirectional interaction, guided by hypotheses and interaction-driven requirements. Potential topics may include creating meaningful task environments (physical, virtual, or hybrid); designing new modalities and interfaces for interaction; developing advanced evaluation, measurement, and instrumentation methods; testbeds, and improving real-time integration of multi-modal sensorimotor data.</li>

A new approach is needed. This approach requires a proactive and scalable perspective that recognizes the variety and connectedness of components of wildland fire. Coordinated scientific research and education that enables large-scale, cross-cutting breakthroughs to transform our understanding of wildland fire is urgently needed. In an era of rapid change, our society needs forward-looking research built on new frameworks that will realign our relationship with wildland fire.


The Fire Science Innovations through Research and Education (FIRE) program invites innovative multidisciplinary and multisector investigations focused on convergent research and education activities in wildland fire. All areas of science, engineering, and education supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation are included in this program. Projects developed by a wide array of groups including, for example, academics, educators, scientists, community members, students, industry partners, practitioners, resource managers, and Tribal representatives, working together to generate new knowledge of the interactions among biological, social, geoscientific, and engineering processes encompassing multiple fields, scales, and perspectives on wildland fire are encouraged.


To advance convergent research and education in wildland fire science, FIRE proposals should demonstrate strengths in one or more of the following areas: (1) new advances in data collection, storage, and sharing relevant to wildland fire dynamics, including Earth observations; (2) new modeling and computational approaches to understand wildland fire (including artificial intelligence and machine learning approaches); (3) new understanding of the cross-scale interactions of wildland fire across local, regional and global extents; (4) new insights into community adaptation and governance relevant to wildland fire; (5) new approaches to reduce the vulnerability of built infrastructure, natural fuels, and social systems to wildland fire; and (6) engagement of a variety of community members and stakeholders to promote a forward-looking approach to wildland fire science.


<span>NSF manages the review of proposals in consultation with partner organizations. Copies of proposals and unattributed reviews will be shared with the partner organizations, as appropriate.</span>


FIRE supports research proposals and conference (network) proposals that focus on one or more of the following elements:


Focus area 1: Next Generation Coupled Fire Models (FIRE-MODEL)


Understanding wildland fires and smoke requires new predictive approaches and models to capture the full spatial and temporal range of unresolved dynamics. Furthermore, model development efforts necessitate well-coordinated experiments ranging from laboratory to landscape scales, along with state-of-the-art data management and analysis approaches. To reduce the current large uncertainties associated with fire models and to discover new weather-fire coupling phenomena driving the increasing frequency of large-scale fires worldwide, advanced experimental, theoretical, and computational methods are needed. The impacts of improved models include increased accuracy, better integration of Earth observation data, more efficient planning of prescribed burns, effective training of work force, timely warnings, and better management of limited human/equipment resources.


Successful FIRE-MODEL proposals are suggested to address the following key themes:

<ul>
<li>Innovative models, methods and algorithms for fire phenomena at disparate spatio-temporal scales, including systematic quantification of various sources of uncertainties and holistic verification and validation of the developed tools and technologies;</li>
<li>Improvement of models with key measurable parameters spanning the full array of wildland fire factors as well as methods to bridge gaps of missing data;</li>
<li>Incorporation of the underlying processes operating on fast and slow timescales, to potentially enable predictive fire ecology, exploration of possible future fire regimes, and forecasting of future wildland fires; and</li>
<li>Novel mathematical and statistical methodologies and use-inspired technologies to accelerate experiments on wildland fire and smoke dynamics and reliably infer the associated uncertainties; such directions may include but are not limited to surrogate models and digital twins.</li>
</ul>

Focus area 2: Enhancing Capacity for Fire Resilience in the Wildland-Urban Interface (FIRE-WUI)


The space where the built environment and wildland vegetation meet is referred to as the wildland-urban interface (hereafter WUI). It represents a critical nexus of potential human-fire interaction, where lives, infrastructure, and communities are often most vulnerable to wildfire. Research related to the complexities of the WUI requires a convergent, multidisciplinary approach to improve understanding of wildland fire, which can inform risk management and response, adaptation and resilience across infrastructures, communities, cultures, and natural environments.


Considering impacts of wildland fire at the WUI in the context of global change, including demographics, ecosystems, land use and development, FIRE-WUI awards will support research that may for example:

<ul>
<li>Inform community adaptation and governance relevant to wildland fire;</li>
<li>Investigate public perceptions and understanding of wildland fire as well as decision making and communication and the resultant impact on livelihoods and cultural heritage;</li>
<li>Promote better understanding of the socioeconomic disparities related to the impacts of wildfire on remote rural communities;</li>
<li>Test and model behaviors of building materials, structures, and infrastructures under wildfire loads;</li>
<li>Develop novel materials, methods, and technologies for retrofitting existing buildings and remediating buildings following wildfire and smoke events;</li>
<li>Create robust wildfire risk scenarios and algorithms for evaluating cascading failures and community-scale vulnerability.</li>
</ul>

Focus area 3: Fire Science Innovations through Research and Education (FIRE) Networks (FIRE-NET)


FIRE-Network projects will build new collaborative teams to synthesize aspects of wildland fire science and develop strategies for tackling key gaps. These networks will advance wildland fire research, or create new directions in research or education by supporting groups of investigators to communicate and coordinate their research, training, and educational activities across disciplinary, organizational, geographic, and international boundaries. Exchanging knowledge and information across and among different groups is encouraged. Projects will provide opportunities to foster new collaborations, including those with international partners where appropriate, and will address interdisciplinary knowledge and data exchange focused on wildland fire research and education.


Successful FIRE-NET conference proposals are encouraged to include but are not limited to the following types of activities:

<ul>
<li>Leveraging existing and developing data resources to support the development of new wildland fire-related research directions and educational activities;</li>
<li>Employing novel networking strategies and collaborative training technologies to enhance coordination among a variety of fields and knowledge holders;</li>
<li>Developing community standards for data and meta- data use and management in wildland fire research;</li>
<li>Developing mechanisms to share information and ideas, such as bringing together disparate data sources including Earth observation data;</li>
<li>Advancing<span>wildland fire-related science and education through communication, data analysis, ideas sharing, novel collaborations, and workforce development</span>.</li>
</ul>

ROAs similarly support PUI faculty research, but these awards typically allow faculty to work as visiting scientists at research-intensive organizations where they collaborate with other NSF-supported investigators. 



Eligible PUIs are accredited colleges and universities (including two-year community colleges) that award Associate's degrees, Bachelor's degrees, and/or Master's degrees in NSF-supported fields, but have awarded 20 or fewer Ph.D./D.Sci. degrees in all NSF-supported fields during the combined previous two academic years. 



All NSF directorates may support RUI and ROA funding activities. Funding for these awards is contained within research and education program allocations and not held as a separate allocation. RUI and ROA proposals are evaluated and funded by NSF programs in the disciplinary areas of the proposed research and are funded at their discretion. 


Prospective PIs should contact disciplinary program officers to identify specific NSF programs and to determine the feasibility and timing of RUI/ROA requests.

Such systems form the backbone of society, providing essential services as well as ensuring public health and welfare, economic prosperity and national security, and are expected to function under all operational conditions.





Meanwhile, infrastructure systems are capital intensive and vulnerable to disruptions from extreme events, including natural disasters, social crises, and malicious attacks. Disruptions in one system can have cascading impacts on others in space and over time. Moreover, short- versus long-term trade-offs, unintended consequences, and maladaptation are not often accounted for. How systems function at the &ldquo;extreme,&rdquo; which can be due to disruptors from the introduction of innovation, the convergence of technologies, sudden changes to their utilization and access, dramatic changes in operating environments, and changes to demand during crises are of particular interest. To ensure the efficiency, sustainability, resilience, and fair use of infrastructure systems, it is important to continuously improve and optimize their design, operations, system monitoring and performance assessment in dynamic, uncertain and sometime unknown environments. While functioning at extremes is of interest, the program also supports infrastructure systems research under the full range of operating conditions, across a variety of hazards, and in urban, suburban, and rural communities.





The program particularly encourages interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary exploration that will open new research frontiers and significantly expand and transform relevant research communities. The program welcomes research that addresses novel system integration, user-inspired system and service design, data analytics, and socio-technical studies focused on engineering and system innovation during normal and extreme conditions. The program also values innovative research efforts focused on collecting, standardizing, and sharing large-scale databases of real-world infrastructure systems and people-infrastructure interactions during normal and extreme operating conditions, which can be instrumental in providing benchmarks for model verification and validation and for advancing future research innovation in ISP.





The ISP program supports research on lifeline systems and communities that contributes to the National Science Foundation&rsquo;s role in the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP) and the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program (NWIRP). Principal Investigators are encouraged to leverage NSF&rsquo;s investments in the Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) experimental, computational modeling and simulation, and data resources (https://www.designsafe-ci.org/) in their research to accelerate advances needed for reducing the impacts of natural hazards on infrastructures and people.





While physics-based subject-matter knowledge may be crucial in many research efforts, the program does not support research whose primary methodological contribution focuses on individual infrastructure components without a systems research perspective whose primary methodological focus is on geotechnical and structural engineering, material sciences, architectural engineering, wireless communication and sensor technology, human factors, and/or hydrologic or environmental engineering.





Proposers are actively encouraged to email a one-page project summary to the ISP Program Officers before submitting a full proposal for guidance on whether the proposed research topic falls within the scope of the ISP program; this guidance should especially be requested for multi-disciplinary research proposals, and proposals for which research and/or development on the subject infrastructure(s) are also supported by other federal and/or state agencies.",http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=506398,7,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,"[{"applicant_type_id": 8, "applicant_type_name": "Unrestricted (i.e., open to any type of entity above), subject to any clarification in text field entitled \"Additional Information on Eligibility\""}]"

Background:  
The goal of PEMS is to measurably and substantially reduce the prevalence of human trafficking and the harms associated with the crime in targeted populations through innovative interventions driven by research, monitoring, evaluation, and learning, and the expansion of partnerships with government, academia, civil society organizations, international organizations and the private sector. The U.S. Congress has appropriated $25 million annually since 2016 for PEMS, with $200 million in funding obligated to date.
 
The TIP Office intends to further build the evidence base around what interventions work effectively to address trafficking in persons through funding the implementation and rigorous evaluation of high-potential and high-impact promising interventions. The TIP Office intends to consider interventions that have some evidence pointing to their effectiveness which could benefit from an evaluation to validate the intervention approach and answer important research questions about what is effective in anti-trafficking in persons programming. The TIP Office will consider interventions that have shown promise but have not had the funding to be rigorously evaluated; interventions that have shown success in other fields but have not been adapted and tested as a human trafficking intervention; and interventions for which there is a design for programming supported by significant research, which have not yet had the funding to implement and evaluate. Local expertise will be considered critical for implementing projects under this future opportunity.

Cyberspace has evolved from an interconnected digital environment into a complex and interdependent cyber ecosystem that involves hardware, software, networks, data, people, organizations, countries, and the physical world. Critical functions of everyday life are deeply intertwined with computing, including health, government, commerce, the public sphere, education, critical infrastructure, interpersonal communication, and transportation. The complexity and inter-dependencies in cyberspace can be misused and exploited by malicious actors. These in turn can trigger adverse outcomes such as disruption of critical infrastructure and systems; theft of intellectual property and sensitive data; amplification of inequalities; disclosure of private information of individuals, organizations, and governments; and threats to lives, livelihoods, and reputations. Furthermore, constant attacks on the data and assets of corporations, governments, and individuals undermine people&rsquo;s trust in decision-making and processes that depend critically on these cyber systems.

<p class="paragraph">The Security, Privacy, and Trust in Cyberspace (SaTC 2.0) program aims to build trust in global cyber ecosystems. Trust is the core tenet of this program and, for the purposes of this solicitation, is broadly defined to include our confidence in the security, privacy, and resilience of cyberspace, particularly in the face of malicious intent. Achieving this level of confidence in cyberspace requires not only understanding the vulnerabilities in a system that could be exploited and how they can be addressed, but also understanding the social and technical dimensions of trust in cyber systems, along with the educational efforts needed to increase public awareness of risks in cyberspace, and building a well-trained corps of privacy and security professionals.


SaTC 2.0 spans the interests of NSF's Directorates for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE), Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS), Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences (SBE), and STEM Education (EDU). Proposals must be submitted pursuant to one of the following designations, each of which may have additional requirements: 

<ul>
<li>RES: The Research (RES) designation is the focus of the multidisciplinary SaTC 2.0 research program. RES projects are limited to $1,200,000 in total budget, with durations of up to four years. Proposals with a total budget of more than $600,000 have additional requirements including Broadening Participation in Computing and collaboration plans. RES proposals may include an optional Transition to Education (TTE) plan with a budget up to $50,000 (within the RES total budget request) to co-evolve novel educational initiatives in the context of the proposed research.</li>
<li>EDU: The Education (EDU) designation is used to identify proposals focusing on education and workforce training in building trust in security, privacy, and resilience of cyberspace. EDU proposals are limited to $500,000 in total budget, with durations of up to three years. EDU proposals that primarily focus on education research with demonstrated collaboration, as reflected in the PI team between cybersecurity subject matter experts and education researcher(s), may request an additional $100,000 beyond the $500,000 limit.</li>
<li>SEED: The Seedling (SEED) category is intended for special topics defined by accompanying Dear Colleague Letters. SEED projects are limited to $300,000 in total budget, with durations of up to two years.</li>

Ultimately, the S-STEM program seeks to increase the number of academically promising low-income students who graduate with an S-STEM eligible degree and contribute to the American innovation economy with their STEM knowledge. Recognizing that financial aid alone cannot increase retention and graduation in STEM, the program provides awards to institutions of higher education (IHEs) not only to fund scholarships, but also to adapt, implement, and study evidence-based curricular and co-curricular<sup>[a]</sup> activities that have been shown to be effective in supporting recruitment, retention, transfer (if appropriate), student success, academic/career pathways, and graduation in STEM.


To be eligible, scholars must be domestic low-income students with academic ability, talent, or potential and demonstrated unmet financial need who are enrolled in an associate, baccalaureate, or graduate degree program in an S-STEM eligible discipline. Proposers must provide an analysis that articulates the characteristics and academic needs of the population of students they are trying to serve. NSF is particularly interested in supporting the attainment of degrees in fields identified as critical needs for the Nation. It is up to the proposer to make a compelling case that such a field serves a critical need in the United States.

Studies may be either hypothesis-generating (unbiased discovery) or hypothesis-testing in design and may utilize in vivo, in situ or in vitro experimental paradigms, e.g., model organisms or human cell-based assays. While behavioral paradigms and outcome measures can be incorporated into the research design to facilitate the characterization of intracellular, transcellular, and circuit mechanisms, these are neither required nor expected. Studies should not attempt to model disorders but instead should aim to elucidate the neurobiological impact of individual or combined risk factor(s), such as the affected molecular and cellular components and their relationships within defined biological process(es).

For the purposes of this NOFO, the term complex can refer to a multifactorial contribution to risk (e.g., polygenic and/or environmental) and/or highly distributed functional features of the brain disorder. Studies may be either hypothesis-generating (unbiased discovery) or hypothesis-testing in design and may utilize in vivo, in situ, or in vitro experimental paradigms, e.g., model organisms or human cell-based assays. While behavioral paradigms and outcome measures can be incorporated into the research design to facilitate the characterization of intracellular, transcellular and circuit mechanisms, these are neither required nor expected. Studies should not attempt to model disorders but instead should aim to elucidate the neurobiological impact of individual or combined risk factor(s), such as the affected molecular and cellular components and their relationships within defined biological process(es). This can include the fundamental biology of these factors, components and processes. The resulting paradigms, component pathways and biological processes should be disseminated with sufficient detail to enrich common and/or federated data resources (e.g., those contributing to the Gene Ontology, Synaptic Gene Ontology, FAIR Data Informatics) in order to bridge the gap between disease risk factors, biological mechanism and therapeutic target identification.

<p>AGENCY OVERVIEW</p>
<p>The Advanced Research Projects Agency – Energy (ARPA-E), an organization within the Department of Energy (DOE), is chartered by Congress in the America COMPETES Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-69), as amended by the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-358), as further amended by the Energy Act of 2020 (P.L. 116-260):</p>
<p>“(A) to enhance the economic and energy security of the United States through the development of energy technologies that—</p>
<p>(i) reduce imports of energy from foreign sources;</p>
<p>(ii) reduce energy-related emissions, including greenhouse gases;</p>
<p>(iii) improve the energy efficiency of all economic sectors;</p>
<p>(iv) provide transformative solutions to improve the management, clean-up, and disposal of radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel; and</p>
<p>(v) improve the resilience, reliability, and security of infrastructure to produce, deliver, and store energy; and</p>
<p>(B) to ensure that the United States maintains a technological lead in developing and deploying advanced energy technologies.”</p>
<p>ARPA-E issues this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) under its authorizing statute codified at 42 U.S.C. § 16538. The NOFO and any cooperative agreements or grants made under this NOFO are subject to 2 C.F.R. Part 200 as supplemented by 2 C.F.R. Part 910.</p>
<p>ARPA-E funds research on, and the development of, transformative science and technology solutions to address the energy and environmental missions of the Department. The agency focuses on technologies that can be meaningfully advanced with a modest investment over a defined period of time in order to catalyze the translation from scientific discovery to early-stage technology. For the latest news and information about ARPA-E, its programs and the research projects currently supported, see: http://arpa-e.energy.gov/.</p>
<p>ARPA-E funds transformational research. Existing energy technologies generally progress on established “learning curves” where refinements to a technology and the economies of scale that accrue as manufacturing and distribution develop drive improvements to the cost/performance metric in a gradual fashion. This continual improvement of a technology is important to its increased commercial deployment and is appropriately the focus of the private sector or the applied technology offices within DOE. In contrast, ARPA-E supports transformative research that has the potential to create fundamentally new learning curves. ARPA-E technology projects typically start with cost/performance estimates well above the level of an incumbent technology. Given the high risk inherent in these projects, many will fail to progress, but some may succeed in generating a new learning curve with a projected cost/performance metric that is significantly better than that of the incumbent technology. ARPA-E will provide support at the highest funding level only for submissions with significant technology risk, aggressive timetables, and careful management and mitigation of the associated risks.</p>
<p>ARPA-E funds technology with the potential to be disruptive in the marketplace. The mere creation of a new learning curve does not ensure market penetration. Rather, the ultimate value of a technology is determined by the marketplace, and impactful technologies ultimately become disruptive – that is, they are widely adopted and displace existing technologies from the marketplace or create entirely new markets. ARPA-E understands that definitive proof of market disruption takes time, particularly for energy technologies. Therefore, ARPA-E funds the development of technologies that, if technically successful, have clear disruptive potential, e.g., by demonstrating capability for manufacturing at competitive cost and deployment at scale.</p>
<p>ARPA-E funds applied research and development (R&amp;D). The Office of Management and Budget defines “applied research” as an “original investigation undertaken in order to acquire new knowledge…directed primarily towards a specific practical aim or objective” and defines “experimental development” as “creative and systematic work, drawing on knowledge gained from research and practical experience, which is directed at producing new products or processes or improving existing products or processes.”0F1 Applicants interested in receiving financial assistance for basic research (defined by the Office of Management and Budget as “experimental or theoretical work undertaken primarily to acquire new knowledge of the underlying foundations of phenomena and observable facts”)1 should contact the DOE’s Office of Science (http://science.energy.gov/). Office of Science national scientific user facilities (http://science.energy.gov/user-facilities/) are open to all researchers, including ARPA-E Applicants and awardees. These facilities provide advanced tools of modern science including accelerators, colliders, supercomputers, light sources and neutron sources, as well as facilities for studying the nanoworld, the environment, and the atmosphere. Projects focused on early-stage R&amp;D for the improvement of technology along defined roadmaps may be more appropriate for support through the DOE applied energy offices including: the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (http://www.eere.energy.gov/), the Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management (https://www.energy.gov/fecm/office-fossil-energy-and-carbon-management), the Office of Nuclear Energy (http://www.energy.gov/ne/office-nuclear-energy), and the Office of Electricity (https://www.energy.gov/oe/office-electricity).</p>
<p>ARPA-E encourages submissions stemming from ideas that still require proof-of-concept R&amp;D efforts as well as those for which some proof-of-concept demonstration already exists. Submissions can propose a project with the end deliverable being an extremely creative, but partial solution.</p>
<p>PROGRAM OVERVIEW</p>
<p>The Seeding Critical Advances for Leading Energy technologies with Untapped Potential (SCALEUP) Ready program provides a vital mechanism for the support of innovative energy R&amp;D that complements ARPA-E’s primary focus on early-stage transformational energy technologies that require proof of concept.</p>
<p>Technologies that achieve substantial technical advancement under ARPA-E support may still face significant technical and commercial challenges upon completion of an award's funding period, and thus are at risk of being stranded in their development path once ARPA-E funding ends. Experience across ARPA-E’s diverse energy portfolios, and input from a wide range of investors and industry stakeholders, indicate that pre-commercial scaling projects are critical to establish practical performance and cost parameters. These pre-commercial scaling projects aim to 1) translate the performance achieved at bench scale to commercially scalable versions of the technology, 2) integrate the technology with broader systems, 3) provide extended performance data, and 4) validate the manufacturability and reliability of new energy technologies. Successful scaling projects should enable industry stakeholders to justify the substantial commitments of financial resources, personnel, manufacturing facilities, and materials necessary to subsequently deploy the technologies at a commercial scale.</p>
<p>SCALEUP Ready seeks to scale the most promising technologies previously funded by ARPA-E. The possibility of ARPA-E-funded technologies becoming stranded along their development pathways leaves substantial intellectual property developed with American taxpayer dollars vulnerable to adoption by foreign competitors, who capture it for continued development and economic benefit overseas. This harms national competitiveness, as U.S. industries often fall behind on the development, scaling, and manufacturing of technologies necessary to compete in rapidly evolving global energy markets. Thus, projects selected for SCALEUP Ready will meet ARPA-E’s statutory goals by “accelerating transformational technological advances in areas that industry by itself is not likely to undertake because of technical and financial uncertainty."</p>",https://arpa-e-foa.energy.gov,93,1,20000000.00,5000000.00,NULL,"[{"applicant_type_id": 8, "applicant_type_name": "Unrestricted (i.e., open to any type of entity above), subject to any clarification in text field entitled \"Additional Information on Eligibility\""}]"

AGS encourages and inspires scientific leaders by investing in the atmospheric and geospace sciences, enhancing educational opportunities and experiences and supporting faculty and researchers at all career stages. The Division expects that proposers will integrate education, outreach and dissemination activities into their research plans in compliance with NSF Broader Impacts Merit Review criteria.



AGS invites proposals that include plans for workforce development, educational and outreach activities, open science initiatives and efforts to broaden participation and encourage diverse talent in the atmosphere and geospace sciences. Furthermore, AGS encourages proposals from all institutions, including Minority Serving Institutions, Emerging Research Institutions and institutions in EPSCoR jurisdictions.



The Proposal & Award Policies & Procedures Guide (PAPPG) provides the instructions for submitting proposals to AGS. Additionally, Chapter II.F of the PAPPG defines "Other Types of Proposals," including community-building proposals such as Conference, Travel or Planning Proposals and special categories of proposals, such as Rapid Response Research (RAPID) and EArly-concept Grants for Exploratory Research (EAGER). Proposals that are not compliant with the PAPPG will be returned without review.



The following sections highlight specific NSF-, GEO-, or AGS-wide solicitations that may be relevant to the AGS Community. Please be aware that solicitations are frequently updated, so make sure that you are looking at the most recent version.

A growing number of topics are best addressed on a multilateral basis, building partnerships that leverage diverse expertise, data, infrastructure, and perspectives to advance understanding on critical topics of regional or global importance. At the same time, funders, research organizations, and researchers alike typically have limited experience with multilateral partnerships. 


The Office of International Science and Engineering&rsquo;s MultiPLEx program seeks to support visionary, and ambitious international multilateral research partnerships that are required to hasten progress in addressing grand challenges by leveraging research excellence in the U.S. and around the globe. The program also seeks to advance understanding of effective multilateral collaboration.

Many NSF-funded projects result in publicly accessible, modifiable, and distributable open-source products, including software, hardware, models, specifications, programming languages, or data platforms that catalyze further innovation. In some cases, an open-source product that shows potential for wide adoption forms the basis for a self-sustaining open-source ecosystem (OSE) that comprises a leadership team; a managing organization with a well-defined governance structure and distributed development model; a cohesive community of external intellectual content developers; and a broad base of users across academia, industry, and/or government. The overarching vision of POSE is that proactive and intentional formation of managing organizations will ensure adoption of open-source products; increased coordination of external intellectual content developer contributions; and a more focused route to technologies with broad societal impact. Toward this end, the POSE program supports the formation of new OSE managing organizations based on an</span>existing open-source product or class of products, whereby each organization is responsible for the creation and management of processes and infrastructure needed for the efficient and secure development and maintenance of an OSE.


POSE constitutes a new pathway to translate scientific innovations, akin to the Lab-to-Market Platform that NSF has pioneered over many decades. Whereas programs like the<a href="https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/innovation-corps-teams-program/nsf21-552/solicitation">NSF Innovation Corps (NSF I-Corps&trade;)</a>and<a href="https://seedfund.nsf.gov/">America&rsquo;s Seed Fund[Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR)]</a>represent an integrated set of programs to provide researchers with the capacity to transform their fundamental research into deep technology ventures, POSE is specifically focused on another translational pathway &ndash; supporting the transition from open-source research artifacts to OSEs.


Importantly, the POSE program isnotintended to fund thedevelopmentof open-source products, including tools and artifacts. The POSE program is alsonotintended to fund existing well-resourced, open-source communities or ecosystems. Instead, the program aims to supportnewmanaging organizations to catalyze distributed, community-driven development and growth ofnewOSEs. The expected outcomes of the POSE program are to grow the community of researchers and innovators who develop and contribute to OSE efforts, and to enable pathways for the safe and secure development of OSEs that have broad societal impacts. OSEs can emerge from any areas of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) research and development.


This solicitation seeks two types of proposals, allowing teams to propose specific activities toscope and planthe establishment of an OSE (Phase I), and toestablisha sustainable OSE based on a robust open-source product that shows promise in the ability to both meet an emergent societal or national need and build a community to help develop it (Phase II).


Phase I: OSE Scoping and Planning Proposals


Phase I projects are for open-source research products with a small community of external users though the product may not necessarily have external content developers. The objectives of Phase I projects are to: (1) enable scoping activities that will inform the transition of promising research products that are already available in open-source formats into sustainable and robust OSEs that will have broad societal impacts, and (2) provide training to teams interested in building such an OSE.


Phase I awardees are not obligated to submit Phase II proposals in the future.


Phase II: Establishment and Expansion Proposals


Phase II projects are for open-source research products with small, existing communities of external usersandexternal content developers. The objective of Phase II projects is to support the transition of a promising open-source product into a sustainable and robust OSE. Phase II proposal teams are expected to have already conducted the scoping activities needed to develop a detailed project plan to support the community-driven distributed development and deployment of successful open-source tools into operational environments (not necessarily via a Phase I award).

With its Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program and Major Multi-user Facilities ("Major Facilities") projects, NSF supports infrastructure projects at the lower and higher range of infrastructure project costs, Foundation-wide, across science and engineering research disciplines. The Foundation-wide Mid-scale Research Infrastructure opportunity is intended to provide NSF with an agile, Foundation-wide process to fund experimental research capabilities in the mid-scale range between MRI and Major Multi-user Facilities.


NSF defines Research Infrastructure (RI) as any combination of facilities, equipment, instrumentation, or computational hardware or software, and the necessary human capital in support of the same. Major facilities and mid-scale projects are subsets of research infrastructure. The NSF Mid-scale Research Infrastructure-1 Program (Mid-scale RI-1) supports either design activities or implementation of unique and compelling RI projects. Mid-scale implementation projects may include any combination of equipment, instrumentation, cyberinfrastructure, broadly used large scale datasets and the personnel needed to successfully commission the project. Mid-scale RI-1 design activities include the design efforts intended to lead to eventual implementation of a mid-scale class RI project. Mid-scale RI-1 projects should involve the training of a diverse workforce engaged in the design and implementation of STEM research infrastructure. Mid-scale RI-1 projects should directly enable advances in any of the research domains supported by NSF. Projects may also include upgrades to existing research infrastructure.


Mid-scale RI-1 emphasizes strong scientific merit, a response to an identified need of the research community and/or fulfillment of a national need to enable U.S. researchers to be competitive in a global research environment. Well-conceived technical and management plans are essential for both design and implementation proposals, as are well-developed plans (e.g., mentoring and professional development) for student training and the involvement of a diverse STEM workforce in all aspects of mid-scale design and/or implementation activities. The inclusion of individual project participants that will lead to a supportive working environment is especially encouraged at all levels of the project team.


Within Mid-scale RI-1, proposers may submit two types of projects, &ldquo;Implementation&rdquo; (e.g., acquisition and/or construction) or &ldquo;Design&rdquo;. The &ldquo;Design&rdquo; track is intended to facilitate progress toward readiness for a mid-scale range implementation project. Both Implementation projects and Design activities may involve new or upgraded research infrastructure. Mid-scale RI-1 "Implementation" projects may have a total project cost ranging from $4 million up to but not including $20 million. Mid-scale RI-1 "Design" activities may request less than $4 million, with a minimum request of $400,000 and a maximum request up to but not including $20 million, as appropriate, to prepare for a future mid-scale range implementation project. Note: Successful award of a Mid-scale RI-1 design activity does not imply NSF's commitment to the future implementation of the project being designed, nor is a Mid-scale RI-1 design award required for the submission of an implementation project.


The Mid-scale RI-1 Program seeks to broaden the representation of PIs and institutions in its award portfolio, including a geographically diverse set of institutions (especially those in EPSCoR jurisdictions). Proposals submitted by, or involving partnerships between institutions are encouraged. Participation in this opportunity is encouraged for the full spectrum of diverse talent society has to offer to include PIs who are women, early-career researchers, persons with disabilities, or members of other groups underrepresented in STEM. To improve participation in science and engineering research for persons with disabilities, Mid-scale RI-1 encourages PIs to incorporate accessibility as part of Mid-scale RI-1 design activity and implementation projects.


Please consult NSF's Research Infrastructure Guide, or RIG (available at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/lfo/lfo_documents.jsp">https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/lfo/lfo_documents.jsp</a>), for definitions of certain terms used in this solicitation, such as the Project Execution Plan (PEP) and Design and Execution Plan (DEP). The RIG provides guidance specific to Mid-scale Research Infrastructure Projects, including references to other parts of the RIG as needed. Note that PEP or DEP should be appropriately scaled for the complexity of the project and may not require all of the elements described in the RIG.

The goal of the Computational and Data-enabled Science and Engineering (CDS&amp;E) meta-program is to identify and capitalize on opportunities for major scientific and engineering breakthroughs through new computational and data-analysis approaches and best practices. The CDS&amp;E meta-program supports projects that harness computation and data to advance knowledge and accelerate discovery above and beyond the goals of the participating individual programs. The intellectual drivers may be in an individual discipline or cut across more than one discipline in various Divisions and Directorates. A CDS&amp;E proposal should enable and/or utilize the development and adaptation of advances in research and infrastructure in computational and data science.


The CDS&amp;E meta-program encourages research that pushes the envelope of science and engineering through computation and data, welcoming proposals in any research area supported by the participating divisions. A proposal may address topics that develop or enable interactions among theory, computing, experiment, and observation to achieve progress on hitherto intractable science and engineering problems. Areas of emphasis for CDS&amp;E vary by program. PIs are advised to consult the "related programs" links below before submitting.


The CDS&amp;E meta-program is not intended to replace existing programs that support projects involving computation or the analysis of large or complex data sets using established methods. Rather, proposals submitted to the CDS&amp;E meta-program must have a significant component of computational or data science that goes well beyond what would typically be included in these programs.Any proposal submitted to the CDS&amp;E program that is not responsive to this Program Description may be transferred to or reviewed within the context of an individual program. A proposal requesting consideration within the context of CDS&amp;E should begin the title with the identifying acronym "CDS&amp;E:". Supplement requests to existing awards may also be considered. A CDS&amp;E proposal should include substantive science, engineering, or computing research. Algorithm and pilot software development supporting science and engineering may also be appropriate, depending on the program. Proposers who seek to implement proven, existing methods into robust cyberinfrastructure are referred instead to the program on <a href="https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/cyberinfrastructure-sustained-scientific" target="_blank">Cyberinfrastructure for Sustained Scientific Innovation</a> (CSSI).


A CDS&amp;E proposal should be submitted to one of the "Related Programs" or Divisions by the associated submission window, deadline, or target date listed in the table below. In picking the most relevant program, PIs are advised to read program descriptions and solicitations carefully and consult with cognizant Program Officers before proposal preparation. Proposal submissions outside the receiving program's scientific scope may be transferred to a different program or returned without review.

In conformance with the NQI goals, an argument<sup>2-5</sup>was set forth for a renewed emphasis on identifying and fostering early adoption of quantum technologies to transform the field of Quantum Information Science and Engineering (QISE) and to accelerate broader impacts on society. A systematic approach to maturing quantum technology platforms by integrating end-users and potential customers from other fields of science and engineering and other sectors of the economy into cycles of research, development, and demonstration should lower the barriers for end-users to pioneer new applications. NSF support for use-inspired and translational research in QISE, combined with continued strong support of the underlying foundational research, is anticipated to accelerate development of a market for quantum technologies.


With this program solicitation, the Foundation is taking the next step in implementing the National Quantum Virtual Laboratory (NQVL) concept as an overarching shared infrastructure designed to facilitate the translation from basic science and engineering to the resultant technology, while at the same time emphasizing and advancing its scientific and technical value. The NQVL aims to develop and utilize use-inspired and application-oriented quantum technologies. In the process, NQVL researchers will explore quantum frontiers<sup>6</sup>, foster the development of QISE education and workforce development strategies, engage in outreach activities at all levels, and promote input and participation from the full spectrum of talent in QISE, thereby lowering barriers at all entry points of the research enterprise. Engagement with all sectors of the United States (U.S.) QISE community will be necessary for this initiative to succeed, and, indeed, the project is designed to include participation from a full spectrum of organizations who have expertise to contribute. In particular, NSF recognizes that the involvement of industry partners is essential and will welcome these to be a part of the overall structure. Partnerships with other U.S. Federal agencies under the NQI umbrella are also encouraged.


While this solicitation lays out the vision for the entire NQVL program that includes Quantum Science and Technology Demonstration (QSTD) projects, support for enabling technologies through Transformative Advances in Quantum Systems (TAQS), as well as a central coordination hub, only proposals for Design- and Implementation-phase QSTDs are solicited at this time.


Submission of a QSTD:Design proposal is contingent upon the existence of a QSTD:Pilot project in the same topical area, and the positive recommendation from the Conceptual Design Review of the QSTD:Pilot project. The QSTD:Design project builds on progress made in the QSTD:Pilot phase.


Submission of a QSTD:Implementation proposal is contingent upon the existence of a QSTD:Design project in the same topical area, and the positive recommendation from the Preliminary Design Review of the QSTD:Design project. The QSTD:Implementation project builds on progress made in the QSTD:Design phase.


It is required that prospective PIs contact the NQVL Program Officer(s) as soon as possible, but not later than two weeks before submitting a proposal in response to this solicitation, to ascertain that the focus and budget of their proposal is appropriate for this solicitation.

The program addresses challenges that are both core to DOE&rsquo;s mission and essential to NSF&rsquo;s mission of ensuring broad scientific progress. The program&rsquo;s overarching goal is to elevate correctness as a fundamental requirement for scientific computing tools and tool chains, spanning low-level libraries through complex multi-physics simulations and emerging scientific workflows.


At an elementary level, correctness of a system means that desired behavioral properties will be satisfied during the system&rsquo;s execution. In the context of scientific computing, correctness can be understood, at both the level of software and hardware, as absence of faulty behaviors such as excessive numerical rounding, floating-point exceptions, data races deadlocks, memory faults, violations of specifications at interfaces of system modules, and so on. The CS<sup>2</sup> program puts correctness on an equal footing with performance, the focus of current scientific computing research. This program envisions the necessity of proving correctness even in performant scientific computing systems. Such correctness proofs themselves might rely upon multiple factors, including correctness of static and runtime program analyses. Recognizing that many scientific computing applications are inherently statistical, use probabilistic or randomized algorithms, and/or deal with uncertain data, probabilistic notions of correctness may be needed. It is also critical to realize that correctness guarantees are provided with respect to some pre-defined system model. For many reasons, including misspecification, approximation, and defect, the state space allowed by real systems might depart from that model. When this happens, the ability to probe the system to isolate the discrepancy is a key challenge in many domains.


CS<sup>2</sup> requires close and continuous collaboration between researchers in two complementary areas of expertise. One area is scientific computing, which, for this solicitation, is broadly construed to include: models and simulations of scientific theories; management and analysis of data from scientific simulations, observations, and experiments; libraries for numerical computation; and allied topics. The second area is formal reasoning and mechanized proving of properties of programs, which, for this solicitation, is broadly construed to include automatic/interactive/auto-active verification, runtime verification, type systems, abstract interpretation, programming languages, program analysis, program logic, compilers, concurrency, stochastic reasoning, static and dynamic testing, property-based testing, and allied topics.",http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf24571,7,1,NULL,NULL,18000000.00,"[{"applicant_type_id": 1, "applicant_type_name": "Others (see text field entitled \"Additional Information on Eligibility\" for clarification)"}]"

Critical foundational gaps remain that, if not properly addressed, will soon limit advances in machine learning, curbing progress in artificial intelligence. It appears increasingly unlikely that these critical gaps can be surmounted with increased computational power and experimentation alone. Deeper mathematical understanding is essential to ensuring that AI can be harnessed to meet the future needs of society and enable broad scientific discovery, while forestalling the unintended consequences of a disruptive technology.

Specifically, previous and ongoing evaluations of the NSF Engineering Education and Centers Division program and its predecessors, as well as those related programs in the Directorate for STEM Education, have shown that prior investments have significantly improved the first year of engineering students&rsquo; experiences, incorporating engineering material, active learning approaches, design instruction, and a broad introduction to professional skills and a sense of professional practice &ndash; giving students an idea of what it means to become an engineer. Similarly, the senior year has seen notable change through capstone design experiences, which ask students to synthesize the technical knowledge, skills, and abilities they have gained with professional capacities, using reflective judgment to make decisions and communicate these effectively. However, this ideal of the senior year has not yet been fully realized, because many of the competencies required in capstone design, or required of professional engineers, are only partially introduced in the first year and not carried forward with significant emphasis through the sophomore and junior years.


The Directorates for Engineering (ENG) and STEM Education (EDU) are funding projects as part of the RED program, in alignment with the Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (IUSE) framework and Professional Formation of Engineers (PFE) initiative. These projects are designing revolutionary new approaches to engineering education, ranging from changing the canon of engineering to fundamentally altering the way courses are structured to creating new departmental structures and educational collaborations with industry. A common thread across these projects is a focus on organizational and cultural change within the departments, involving students, faculty, staff, and industry in rethinking what it means to provide an engineering program.


In order to continue to catalyze revolutionary approaches, while expanding the reach of those that have proved efficacious in particular contexts, the RED program supports four tracks: RED Planning (Track 1), RED Adaptation and Implementation (Track 2), RED Innovation (Track 3), and RED Innovation Partnerships (Track 4). Two- and four-year institutions are encouraged to submit to any track as appropriate for their goals and context.


RED Planning (Track 1) projects will support capacity-building activities at institutions of special interest to NSF&rsquo;s mission, specifically two-year engineering-centered programs building transfer partnerships, two-year or four-year institutions in EPSCoR jurisdictions, Primarily Undergraduate Institutions (PUIs), and Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs)seeking to level the number of degrees acrossof the full spectrum of diverse talent in engineering. Planning projects should provide the support for such institutions to explore the development of a RED Projects in Tracks 2, 3, &amp; 4.


RED Adaptation and Implementation (Track 2) projects will adapt and implement evidence-based organizational change strategies and actions to the local context, which helps propagate this transformation of undergraduate engineering education.


RED Innovation (Track 3) projects will develop new, revolutionary approaches and change strategies that enable the transformation of undergraduate engineering education.


RED Innovation Partnerships (Track 4) projects will achieve the same goals as Track 3 projects across multiple institutions. Of particular interest to this track are projects partnering two-year institutions with other eligible institutions.


Projects in tracks 2, 3, &amp; 4 will include consideration of the cultural, organizational, structural, and pedagogical changes needed to transform one or more departments to ones in which students are engaged, develop their technical and professional skills, and establish identities as professional engineers or technologists. The focus of projects in these tracks should be on the department&rsquo;s disciplinary courses and program. RED project initiatives are expected to be institutionalized at the end of the funding period.


Proposals are especially encouraged that address areas of increased national interest including but not limited to advanced manufacturing, advanced wireless, artificial intelligence, biotechnology, microelectronics and semiconductors, net zero technologies, sustainability, systems engineering, and quantum engineering.",http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf24564,7,1,2000000.00,50000.00,8000000.00,"[{"applicant_type_id": 1, "applicant_type_name": "Others (see text field entitled \"Additional Information on Eligibility\" for clarification)"}]"

The cost-sharing of a person or entity in cooperative agricultural on NWRS lands can vary depending on the needs and objectives of the particular NWRS land. For example, the Service may provide the cooperator with the right to perform agricultural practices on NWRS land and a percentage of any resulting crop yield, as well as the ability to use Service water, equipment, and/or refuge staff. In exchange, the cooperator may provide the Service with labor, equipment, and materials; a percentage of any resulting crop yield; and/or maintenance, rehabilitation, or reestablishment of specific habitat conditions on NWRS lands.

The Plant Genome Research Program (PGRP) supports genome-scale research that addresses challenging questions of biological, societal and economic importance. PGRP encourages the development of innovative tools, technologies, and resources that empower a broad plant research community to answer scientific questions on a genome-wide scale. Emphasis is placed on the scale and depth of the question being addressed and the creativity of the approach. Data produced by plant genomics should be usable, accessible, integrated across scales, and of high impact across biology. Training, broadening participation, and career development are essential to scientific progress and should be integrated in all PGRP-funded projects.

Research supported by this program will add to our knowledge of the underlying developmental processes that support social, cognitive, and behavioral functioning, thereby illuminating ways for individuals to live productive lives as members of society.


The Developmental Sciences program supports research that addresses developmental processes within the domains of perceptual, cognitive, social, emotional, language, and motor development across the lifespan by working with any appropriate populations for the topics of interest including infants, children, adolescents, adults (including aging populations), and non-human animals. The program also supports research investigating factors that affect developmental change, including family, peers, school, community, culture, media, physical, genetic, and epigenetic influences. The program funds research that incorporates multidisciplinary, multi-method, and/or longitudinal approaches; develops new methods, models, and theories for studying development; and integrates different processes (e.g., memory, emotion, perception, cognition), levels of analysis (e.g., behavioral, social, neural) and time scales. The program funds basic research that advances our understanding of developmental processes and mechanisms; the program does not fund clinical trials and research focused primarily on health outcomes.


The budgets and durations of supported projects vary widely and are greatly influenced by the nature of the project. Investigators should focus on innovative, potentially transformative research plans and then develop a budget to support those activities, rather than starting with a budget number and working up to that value.


While there are no specific rules about budget limitations, a typical project funded through the Developmental Sciences program is approximately three years in duration with a total cost budget, including both direct and indirect costs, between $100,000 and $200,000 per year. Interested proposers are urged to explore the NSF awards database for the Developmental Sciences program to review examples of awards that have been made. Proposals that contain budgets significantly beyond this range may be returned without review.


The Developmental Sciences program also considers proposals for workshops and small conferences on a case-by-case basis. These typically have total cost budgets, including direct and indirect costs, of approximately $35,000. Conference proposals may only be submitted following an invitation from the Program Directors.


In addition to consulting the NSF awards database, it is often useful for interested proposers to submit (via email) a summary of no more than one page so that a program director can advise the investigator on the fit of the project for DS before the preparation of a full proposal. New investigators are encouraged to solicit assistance in the preparation of their project proposals via consultation with senior researchers in their area, pre-submission review by colleagues, and attendance at symposia and events at professional conferences geared towards educating investigators seeking federal funding.


The Developmental Sciences Program is always interested in identifying new reviewers. Potential reviewers should have a Ph.D. in psychology or a related field and have a demonstrated area of expertise relevant to developmental science. Individuals interested in reviewing for the program should complete an <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/bcsdsreviewer">expression of interest form</a>.<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/bcsdsreviewer"><br /></a>

The program gives high priority to projects that advance mechanistic understanding of the structure, function, and evolution of molecular, subcellular, and cellular systems, especially research that aims at quantitative and predictive knowledge of complex behavior and emergent properties. MCB encourages research exploring new concepts in molecular and cellular biology, while incorporating insights and approaches from other scientific disciplines, such as chemistry, computer science, engineering, mathematics, and physics, to illuminate principles that govern life at the molecular and cellular level. MCB also encourages research that exploits experimental and theoretical approaches and utilizes a diverse spectrum of model and non-model animals, plants, and microbes across the tree of life. Proposals that pursue potentially transformative ideas are welcome, even if these entail higher risk.


This solicitation calls for proposals in research areas supported by the four MCB core clusters, including: (i) structure, dynamics, and function of biomolecules and supramolecular assemblies, especially under physiological conditions (<a href="https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/molecular-biophysics" target="_blank">Molecular Biophysics</a>); (ii) organization, processing, expression, regulation, and evolution of genetic and epigenetic information (<a href="https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/genetic-mechanisms" target="_blank">Genetic Mechanisms</a>); (iii) cellular structure, properties, and function across broad spatiotemporal scales (<a href="https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/cellular-dynamics-function" target="_blank">Cellular Dynamics and Function</a>); and (iv) systems and/or synthetic biology to study complex interactions through modeling or manipulation or design of living systems at the molecular-to-cellular scale (<a href="https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/systems-synthetic-biology" target="_blank">Systems and Synthetic Biology</a>). All MCB clusters prioritize projects that integrate across scales, investigate molecular and cellular evolution, synergize experimental research with computational or mathematical modeling, and/or develop innovative, broadly applicable methods and technologies. Projects that bridge the intellectual edges between MCB clusters are welcome. Projects that integrate molecular and cellular biosciences with other subdisciplines of biology are also welcome through the new Integrative Research in Biology (IntBIO) track.


Regarding health-related challenges, NSF supports basic research in all areas of the biological sciences and recognizes that this foundational research is likely to impact many different areas, including human health. MCB celebrates all the biological science discoveries funded through MCB awards that have had major impacts on health, environment, energy, food production, and other applications. Nevertheless, research focused exclusively on understanding human diseases and their treatment is normally outside of the scope offunding and will be returned without review unless that research significantly advances other fields such as engineering, computer science, or the mathematical and physical sciences.",http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf24539,7,1,NULL,NULL,110000000.00,"[{"applicant_type_id": 1, "applicant_type_name": "Others (see text field entitled \"Additional Information on Eligibility\" for clarification)"}]"

It entails integrating knowledge, methods, and expertise from different disciplines and developing novel paradigms that catalyze scientific discovery and innovation.


GCR identifies<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/od/oia/convergence/index.jsp">Convergence Research</a>as having two primary characteristics:

<ul>
<li>Research driven by a specific and compelling problem.Convergence research is generally inspired by the need to address a specific challenge or opportunity, whether it arises from deep scientific questions or pressing societal needs.</li>
<li>Deep integration across disciplines.As experts from different disciplines pursue common research challenges, their knowledge, theories, methods, data, research communities andlanguages become increasingly intermingled or integrated. New frameworks, paradigms or even disciplines can form sustained interactions across multiple communities.</li>
</ul>

A distinct characteristic of convergence research, in contrast to other forms of multidisciplinary research, is that from the inception, the convergence paradigmintentionallybrings together intellectually diverse researchers and stakeholders to frame the research questions, adopt common frameworks for addressing them, and create and implement innovative scientific approaches for their solution. This includes, when appropriate, developing new integrated theories, methods, research tools, and ways of communicating across disciplines and sectors.Research teams practicing convergence aim to develop sustainable collaborations that may not only create solutions to the specific problem studied, but also develop novel ways of investigating related research questions and open new research vistas.


This GCR solicitation targets multidisciplinary teams who are embracing convergence research as a means of developing highly innovative solutions to complex research problems. GCR proposals are expected to be bold and address scientific or technical challenges and bottlenecks which if resolved have the potential to transform scientific understanding and solve vexing problems. Successful GCR projects are anticipated to lead to paradigm shifting approaches within disciplines, establishment of new scientific communities, or development of transformative technologies that have the potential for broad scientific or societal impact.


The aim of GCR is to cultivate and grow the earliest foundations of convergent approaches for addressing a specific and compelling problem. As such, proposals submitted to this solicitation are expected to explore novel avenues not previously investigated that are at the forefront of advancing science through deep integration. Proposers must make a convincing case that the research to be conducted is within NSF&rsquo;s purview, integrates across NSF directorate or division boundaries, and is currently not supported by other NSF programs or solicitations.


The proposers must outline a five-year research plan delineated in two phases, Phase I: years 1-2, and Phase II: years 3-5.The total budget for Phase I may not exceed $1,200,000, and the total for Phase II may not exceed $2,400,000. Successful proposals will be funded initially for two years. Each team&rsquo;s progress will be evaluated at a reverse site visit near the end of year 2; this will involve preparing a progress report and making a team presentation to a panel of reviewers/site visitors.

The ECLIPSE meta-program has been created to foster an inclusive community of scientists and engineers, an ecosystem spanning multiple NSF Directorates, in the pursuit of translational research at the interface of fundamental plasma science and technological innovation. The ECLIPSE program builds on the long history of NSF leadership in supporting multi-disciplinary research in plasma science and engineering, and is intended to enhance organizational unity within NSF, and potentially with other funding agencies, in considering proposals and supporting projects that may otherwise struggle to find a natural home within the existing hierarchy of Directorates, Divisions, and programs within the Foundation.


Examples of topical areas within the scope of the ECLIPSE program include but are not limited to:

<ul type="disc">
<li>Plasma surface interactions, with applications to, e.g., advanced manufacturing, materials processing, and catalysis.</li>
<li>Atmospheric pressure plasmas and microplasmas with applications to, e.g., microelectronics, plasma agriculture, environmental remediation, and other clean and decarbonized energy goals enabled by electrification of the chemical industry.</li>
<li>Dusty plasmas with applications to, e.g., development of nanomaterials, aerosols, and functionalized surface coatings.</li>
<li>Novel sensor development for highly non-equilibrium plasmas with applications to, e.g., cubesat-based geospace measurements and industrial plasma diagnostics.</li>
<li>Novel computational modeling for multi-component and/or multi-phase plasma systems with applications to, e.g., space weather prediction and plasma reactor design.</li>
<li>Novel studies of plasmons in nano-photonics and nano-optics with applications to, e.g., sub-THz wireless communication and photocatalytic chemical processes.</li>
<li>New chemical measurement science for characterizing processes occurring in plasmas and using plasmas as part of measurement systems with applications to, e.g., analysis of environmental contaminants or identification of forensic evidence.</li>
<li>Study of fundamental chemical reactions and mechanisms in plasmas with applications to, e.g., novel chemical synthesis.</li>

Proposals submitted for consideration by this program should address societal or technological needs within the scope of science and engineering supported by the National Science Foundation. Proposals addressing technology development primarily supported by other US government funding agencies are not eligible for consideration and may be returned without review. Proposers are strongly encouraged to contact the cognizant Program Officers if they are unsure of the suitability of a project to this program.


Proposals submitted for consideration by the ECLIPSE program should satisfy the following criteria:


(1) clearly articulate the fundamental scientific and/or engineering challenge in plasma science and engineering that may be relevant to more than one NSF program;<ins cite="mailto:Mangala%20Sharma" datetime="2021-06-04T14:45"></ins> and


(2) provide a substantive discussion of how a resolution of the stated scientific and/or engineering challenge will address specific societal and/or technological needs identified as priorities by the research communities, policymakers and/or other stakeholders. Depending on the nature of the proposal, the latter may be described as the Intellectual Merit or the Broader Impact of the proposed activity.


The program encourages inclusion of specific efforts to increase the diversity of the ECLIPSE community and to broaden participation of under-represented groups in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) as Broader Impacts of proposed work. The program welcomes proposals from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), other Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs), and institutions in <a href="https://new.nsf.gov/funding/initiatives/epscor/epscor-criteria-eligibility" target="_blank">EPSCoR-eligible jurisdictions</a>, along with collaborations between these institutions. Proposers are also encouraged to address how the proposed efforts may enhance workforce development towards STEM careers associated with the field of plasma science and engineering.


The ECLIPSE program is not intended to replace existing programs. A proposal that is requesting consideration within the context of ECLIPSE should begin the title with the identifying acronym "ECLIPSE:" and should be submitted to one of the "Related Programs" listed below. In choosing the most relevant program, proposers are advised to read program descriptions and solicitations carefully and to consult with cognizant Program Officers in advance of proposal preparation. Proposal submissions outside of the scientific scope of the receiving program may be transferred to a different program or may be returned without review.

<p>ARPA-E funds research on and the development of transformative science and&nbsp;technology solutions to address the energy and environmental missions of the Department.&nbsp;The agency focuses on technologies that can be meaningfully advanced with a modest investment over a defined period of time in order to catalyze the translation from scientific discovery to early-stage technology.&nbsp;For the latest news and information about ARPA-E, its programs and the research projects currently supported, see:&nbsp;<a href="http://arpa-e.energy.gov/" target="_blank">http://arpa-e.energy.gov/</a>.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong><em>ARPA-E funds transformational research. </em></strong>Existing energy technologies generally progress on established “learning curves” where refinements to a technology and the economies of scale that accrue as manufacturing and distribution develop drive down the cost/performance metric in a gradual fashion. This continual improvement of a technology is important to its increased commercial deployment and is appropriately the focus of the private sector or the applied technology offices within DOE. By contrast, ARPA-E supports transformative research that has the potential to create fundamentally new learning curves. ARPA-E technology projects typically start with cost/performance estimates well above the level of an incumbent technology. Given the high risk inherent in these projects, many will fail to progress, but some may succeed in generating a new learning curve with a projected cost/performance metric that is significantly lower than that of the incumbent technology.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong><em>ARPA-E funds technology with the potential to be disruptive in the marketplace</em></strong>. The mere creation of a new learning curve does not ensure market penetration. Rather, the ultimate value of a technology is determined by the marketplace, and impactful technologies ultimately become disruptive – that is, they are widely adopted and displace existing technologies from the marketplace or create entirely new markets. ARPA-E understands that definitive proof of market disruption takes time, particularly for energy technologies. Therefore, ARPA-E funds the development of technologies that, if technically successful, have clear disruptive potential, e.g., by demonstrating capability for manufacturing at competitive cost and deployment at scale.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong><em>ARPA-E funds applied research and development. </em></strong>The Office of Management and Budget defines “applied research” as an “original investigation undertaken in order to acquire new knowledge…directed primarily towards a specific practical aim or objective” and defines “experimental development” as “creative and systematic work, drawing on knowledge gained from research and practical experience, which is directed at producing new products or processes or improving existing products or processes.” (http://science.energy.gov/). Office of Science national scientific user facilities (http://science.energy.gov/user-facilities/) are open to all researchers, including ARPA-E Applicants and awardees. These facilities provide advanced tools of modern science including accelerators, colliders, supercomputers, light sources and neutron sources, as well as facilities for studying the nanoworld, the environment, and the atmosphere. Projects focused on early-stage R&amp;D for the improvement of technology along defined roadmaps may be more appropriate for support through the DOE applied energy offices including: the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (http://www.eere.energy.gov/), the Office of Fossil Energy (http://fossil.energy.gov/), the Office of Nuclear Energy (http://www.energy.gov/ne/office-nuclear-energy), and the Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability (http://energy.gov/oe/office-electricity-delivery-and-energy-reliability).&nbsp;Applicants interested in receiving financial assistance for basic research (defined by the Office of Management and Budget as “experimental or theoretical work undertaken primarily to acquire new knowledge of the underlying foundations of phenomena and observable facts”)&nbsp;should contact the DOE’s Office of Science (http://science.energy.gov/).

<p><strong>&nbsp;<u>Program Overview </u></strong></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This announcement is purposely broad in scope to encourage the submission of the most innovative ideas in energy technology to support transformative energy R&amp;D that complements ARPA-E’s primary mechanism, which is through the solicitation of research projects in focused technology programs.ARPA-E’s focused programs target specific areas of technology that the agency has identified through extensive interaction with the appropriate external stakeholders. The focused programs have significant potential impact on one or more of the statutory goals described in Section I.A of the FOA. Awards made in response to the solicitation for focused programs support the aggressive technical targets established in that solicitation. Taken in total, ARPA-E’s focused programs cover a broad swath of energy technologies and applications.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>However, ARPA-E wants to ensure that there are opportunities to support innovative energy R&amp;D in new and emerging fields that either fall outside of the focused technology programs or that develop after those programs have closed. Within this general framework, ARPA-E seeks transformative ideas that enable the most efficient, economical, sustainable, and environmentally benign utilization of energy. Useful energy can take many forms, including radiant energy from lights, electrical energy for appliances, thermal energy to heat homes, mechanical energy for transportation, chemical energy in the form of food, and energy used to manufacture products.</p>

The IRES program contributes to development of a diverse, globally engaged workforce with world-class skills. IRES focuses on active research participation by undergraduate and/or graduate students in high quality international research, education and professional development experiences in NSF-funded research areas.


The overarching, long-term goals of the IRES program are to enhance U.S. leadership in science and engineering research and education and to strengthen economic competitiveness through training the next generation of science research leaders. IRES focuses on the development of a world-class U.S. STEM workforce through international research experiences for cohorts of U.S. students.


Student participants supported by IRES funds must be citizens, nationals, or permanent residents of the United States.


Students do not apply directly to NSF to participate in IRES activities. Students apply to NSF-funded investigators who receive IRES awards. To identify appropriate IRES projects, students should consult the directory of active <a href="https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/advancedSearchResult?ProgEleCode=079Y%2C080Y%2C7727&amp;BooleanElement=Any&amp;BooleanRef=Any&amp;ActiveAwards=true&amp;&amp;results">IRES</a> <a href="https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/advancedSearchResult?ProgEleCode=079Y%2C080Y%2C7727&amp;BooleanElement=Any&amp;BooleanRef=Any&amp;ActiveAwards=true&amp;&amp;results">awards</a>.


All PIs, co-PIs and Senior Personnel on IRES proposals must be from U.S. based organizations. Personnel from international partners should be listed as "non-NSF funded collaborators." Guidance on information to provide for "non-NSF funded collaborators" is found in Section V.A.


IRES projects engage a group of undergraduate and/or graduate students in active high-quality collaborative research, in principle at an international site with mentorship from international researchers. IRES projects must be organized around a coherent overarching intellectual theme that may involve a single discipline or multiple disciplines funded by NSF.


For all IRES proposals, PIs are strongly encouraged to outline a variety of virtual, hybrid or other alternative approaches to strengthen and maintain international collaboration in addition to travel. It is expected that these approaches will extend collaboration beyond the actual international trip and strengthen IRES proposals overall.

Funded proposals typically relate precise and rich quantifications of physiological responses and behavior in ways that advance theory (Intellectual Merit). Funded proposal also typically strengthen the field through, for example, outreach, mentoring the next generation of diverse cognitive neuroscientists, and/or increasing awareness and utilization of the research the field produces (Broader Impacts).





<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Intellectual Merit</span>


In general, successful proposals provide a theoretical motivation and consist of a series of experiments/analyses that test the differential predictions of that theory; they go beyond quantifying physiology during certain tasks and behaviors. Research topics considered for funding include but are not limited to: perception, recognition, categorization, implicit and explicit memory, working memory, attention, language, decision-making, and social reasoning. Commensurate with the inherently multidisciplinary nature of the field and the limitations of any single technique, a wide variety of physiological methods are considered, including but not limited to: neuroimaging (e.g., fMRI, EEG, MEG), non-invasive stimulation (e.g. TMS, tDCS), lesion analysis, intracranial recording, optogenetics, genetics, optical imaging, computational modeling, and pharmacological interventions in both human and non-human primates and other animal models. The program is particularly interested in proposals that achieve or enable convergence across multiple techniques.


Critically, proposals will be returned without review if they are focused on: 1) either behavior or physiology and lack a specific link between them, 2) understanding clinical populations, 3) non-human animals without a clear benefit to our understanding of humans.


<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span>


<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Broader Impacts</span>


In general, successful proposals make impacts beyond traditional academic routes, such as publishing research or teaching undergraduate courses. Strong broader impacts can be quite varied but will typically involve specific efforts strengthening the field and/or increasing its visibility that leverage the characteristics of the institution, department, and/or researcher. Consider the following non-exhaustive examples: 1) STEM education and outreach, particularly in underserved communities, 2) directly involving undergraduates and high-school students in research, 3) making tools and applications for the general public, 4) science journalism or advocacy. These efforts can, but need not, directly relate to the proposed research. It is also encouraged to include budget for these efforts if warranted.





<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mentoring Plans</span>


Strong mentoring plans generally go beyond inclusion in standard lab activities and incorporate specific ideas for forwarding the careers of young scientists and trainees that leverage the setting and content of the proposed research.


<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span>


<span style="text-decoration: underline;">General Directions</span>


Prior to the development of a full proposal, investigators are strongly encouraged to submit a one-page summary of the proposed research to a program director to evaluate its appropriateness for the CogNeuro program. Please contact the director early enough to allow for revisions and incorporation what may be extensive feedback. The summary should include an overview of your research and statements of intellectual merit and broader impacts, the two NSF review criteria.


See the Merit Review Fact Sheet for more important facts about the NSF merit review process. Please read the NSF Proposal &amp; Award Policies &amp; Procedures Guide (PAPPG) carefully, as it will be strictly adhered to even if other directives or communications appear to contradict it.


Currently, the average standard/CAREER award size is $175,000-$225,000 per year for 3-5 years. Awards in excess of $1.0 million are exceptionally rare and almost always multidisciplinary. Please be judicious in your requests, understanding the realities of the limited funding available for all proposals. See the Listing of Active Cognitive Neuroscience Awards for additional award information.


Declined proposals are ineligible for resubmission until a minimum of one year has passed since the due date of their initial submission, unless specifically allowed by the PO in the feedback received during the decline process. This moratorium allows investigators the time required to digest the results of the merit review and revise their proposal accordingly. A proposal that has not been substantially revised will be returned without review as per the PAPPG.


PIs are strongly encouraged to submit the Single Copy Document titled &ldquo;List of Suggested Reviewers&rdquo; with their full proposal. Sharing of data and other materials is an expectation for funded research. Please consult the NSF Dear Colleague Letter: Effective Practices for Data for more details.

350230,PD-24-1340,"Research in the Formation of Engineers","2023-09-17 00:00:00.000000",NULL,"The NSF Engineering Directorate (ENG) has launched a multi-year initiative, theProfessional Formation of Engineers, to create and support an innovative and inclusive engineering profession for the 21<sup>st</sup>century. Professional Formation of Engineers (PFE) refers to the formal and informal processes and value systems by which people become engineers. It also includes the ethical responsibility of practicing engineers to sustain and grow the profession in order to improve quality of life for all peoples. The engineering profession must be responsive to national priorities, grand challenges, and dynamic workforce needs; it must be equally open and accessible to all.


Professional Formation of Engineers includes, but is not limited, to:

<ul type="disc">
<li>Introductions to the profession at any age;</li>
<li>Development of deep technical and professional skills, knowledge, and abilities in both formal and informal settings/domains;</li>
<li>Development of outlooks, perspectives, ways of thinking, knowing, and doing;</li>
<li>Development of identity as an engineer and its intersection with other identities; and</li>
<li>Acculturation to the profession, its standards, and norms.</li>
</ul>

The goal of the Research in the Formation of Engineers (RFE) program is to advance our understanding of professional formation. It seeks both to deepen our fundamental understanding of the underlying processes and mechanisms that support professional formation and to demonstrate how professional formation is or can be accomplished. Ultimately RFE aims to transform the engineer-formation system, and thus the impact of proposed projects on this system must be described. Principal Investigators (PIs) should provide a roadmap detailing how they envision the proposed research will eventually broadly impact practice within the engineer-formation system, even if these activities are not within the scope of the submitted proposal.


In order to accomplish its goals, RFE welcomes proposals in two categories: Research Projects, and Design and Development Projects. Research Projects address fundamental questions of professional formation, while Design and Development Projects provide new approaches to achieving professional formation. Additional details are provided below. Projects in both categories should address the iterative cycle in which research questions that advance understanding are informed by practice and the results of research are, in turn, translated into practice. In other words, proposals should explain how the research results will travel, translate, transfer, or scale. Successful projects identify specific target audiences, effective communication channels, and novel partnerships to ensure effective propagation and scaling. Proposal titles should begin with either &ldquo;Research:&rdquo; or &ldquo;Design and Development:&rdquo; as appropriate.


Research Projects


Research proposals are particularly welcome in the following areas:

<ul type="disc">
<li>Research that addresses lifelong learning by the engineering workforce.</li>
<li>Research on the impact of engineering education research. Proposals addressing this topic could investigate questions such as: How can we measure the impacts of engineering education research? What are effective strategies for scaling reforms? How can we translate knowledge from research to practice? What are the roles of technologies, networks and communities in achieving impact? RFE does not support efficacy, effectiveness, or scale-up studies for specific interventions.</li>
<li>Research that addresses culture change in engineering education. Included in this topic are investigations of normative cultures of engineering at any level in the engineering education ecosystem and how these cultures may disadvantage certain groups.</li>
<li>Research that addresses engineering formation at the two-year college level in both formal and informal settings.</li>
<li>Research that addresses engineering formation at the graduate education level in both formal and informal settings.</li>
<li>Research that investigates engineering in P-12 settings. Research in this area could include understanding of approaches to engineering in P-12, how to develop engineering ways of thinking, or the relationship between practices within the sciences and mathematics and engineering thinking.</li>
<li>Research on the transitions between education levels, e.g., from high school to two-year college, high school to four-year college/university, two-year college to four-year college/university, undergraduate to graduate school, education settings to the workforce or professoriate, etc.</li>
<li>Research that addresses the relationship between engineering and the public. Proposals addressing this topic could consider the social impact of engineering solutions, citizen engineering, education of an informed public, etc.</li>
<li>Research that develops or adapts novel methodologies and frameworks appropriate for studying the professional formation of engineers, and especially minoritized, marginalized, or underserved populations.</li>
<li>Research that addresses ways in which new technologies (such as artificial intelligence and machine learning) are changing engineering education.</li>
<li>Research to transform engineering education so that all students encounter environmental and social sustainability principles as an integrated part of their education and are equipped with the tools needed to incorporate these principles into their future research, careers, and innovations.</li>
</ul>

Proposals submitted to the Research Projects category should have clear research questions informed by an appropriate theoretical framework and a research design that includes sampling, data collection, and data analysis methods. This category will not support proposals that seek funding primarily to develop tools, curriculum, or laboratories, or that seek to implement classroom innovations that have already been shown to be effective in engineering. The program will evaluate the value of proposals by considering the impact and the cost. Research track projects that are small, exploratory, or speculative are especially encouraged. Larger Research track projects should have a correspondingly larger impact.


Design and Development Projects


RFE supports Design and Development projects (see<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf13126">https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf13126</a>) that seek to develop and test new approaches in the following areas <span>related to engineering education</span>:

<ul type="disc">
<li>Graduate education.</li>
<li>Undergraduate education in new engineering technologies and environmental sustainability.</li>
<li>Transitions between education levels, for example high school to two-year college, high school to four-year college/university, two-year college to four-year college/university, undergraduate to graduate school, education settings to the workforce or professoriate, etc.</li>
<li>P-12, especially approaches to develop engineering thinking, or providing links between engineering, science, and mathematics.</li>
</ul>

Proposals in this category should propose the design and development of new approaches that are informed by existing literature and theory. There should be clear objectives and the evaluation plan should be designed to determine if those objectives have been met.

MOUs of relevance to the Plasma Physics program presently exist with the Department of Energy/Office of Science, National Nuclear Security Administration, the Air Force Office of Scientific Research, the US-Israel Binational Science Foundation, the Czech Science Foundation, Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation), and the Swiss National Science Foundation.


Plasma Physics is a study of matter and physical systems whose intrinsic properties are governed by collective interactions of large ensembles of free charged particles. 99.9% of the visible Universe is thought to consist of plasmas. The underlying physics of the collective behavior in plasmas has applications to space physics and astrophysics, materials science, applied mathematics, fusion science, accelerator science, and many branches of engineering.


The Plasma Physics program supports research that can be categorized by several broad, sometimes overlapping, sub-areas of the discipline, including: magnetized plasmas in the laboratory, space, and astrophysical environments; high energy density plasmas; low temperature plasmas; dusty, ultra-cold, and otherwise strongly coupled plasmas; non-neutral plasmas; and intense field-matter interaction in plasmas. The focus of the Plasma Physics program is to generate an understanding of the fundamental principles governing the physical behavior of a plasma via collective interactions of large ensembles of free charged particles, as well as to improve the basic understanding of the plasma state as needed for other areas of science and engineering.


Principal Investigators (PIs) are encouraged to consider including specific efforts to increase diversity of the plasma physics community and broaden participation of under-represented groups in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) as Broader Impacts of proposed work. Development of new undergraduate and graduate plasma physics curricula, or curricula enhancement to include plasma physics topics in other courses, at institutions lacking such coursework is similarly encouraged.


NSF recognizes that some research projects within this Program may require more than three years to realize demonstrable research outcomes. For such projects, PIs are encouraged to consult the above Program Director to discuss the possibility of submitting a proposal of 4- or 5-year duration.

As such, the Accelerating Research through International Network-to-Network Collaborations program (AccelNet) values cooperation over competition. Program goals are to 1) leverage prior NSF support for building research capacity towards activities that launch international research network of networks (NoN) that will lead to an accelerated advancement of an area of science after the award period and 2) recruit and foster a diverse and internationally competent US-based workforce trained in conducting and leading multi-team international collaboration. Any area funded by the National Science Foundation is eligible, particularly those addressing grand research challenges identified within research communities and/or by NSF.


Successful proposals will demonstrate that the proposed activities will: 1) accelerate scientific research at a rate that would not be possible without concerted international cooperation in research planning; 2) make NoN members more competitive for research awards following the period of award; 3) recruit and foster a US-based diverse and internationally competent workforce trained in conducting and leading multi-team international collaboration. Proposals must include detailed plans for collaborative networking activities that will result in a synergy of effort across the entire NoN.


The AccelNet Program has two tracks. The Design Track allows PIs to build on prior research by providing time and resources for building capacity across teams to launch a synergistic international NoN. The Implementation Track allows PIs to build on prior research or networking activities by providing time and resources to implement an international NoN. There are two phases to the Implementation Track. Phase 1 funding is for activities related exclusively to NoN activities and is open to all PIs, including but not limited to prior successful Design Track PIs. Phase 2 funding is for early concept research arising from Phase 1 activities and is only open to Phase 1 PIs who have identified a critical research gap during synergistic networking activities in the first 18-24 months of Phase 1 awards.",NULL,7,1,NULL,NULL,10000000.00,"[{"applicant_type_id": 1, "applicant_type_name": "Others (see text field entitled \"Additional Information on Eligibility\" for clarification)"}]"

Each of these windows provides a different view. Together they reveal a detailed picture of the Universe that will allow us to study matter, energy, and the cosmos in fundamentally new ways.


The &ldquo;Windows on the Universe&rdquo; Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (WoU-MMA) program identifies three categories of messengers - electromagnetic waves, high-energy particles including neutrinos and cosmic rays, and gravitational waves. The goals of WoU-MMA are to build the capabilities and accelerate the synergy between observations and theory to realize integrated, multi-messenger astrophysical explorations of the Universe.


The WoU-MMA program welcomes proposals in any area of research supported through the participating divisions that address at least one of the following criteria:

<ul>
<li>Coordination: Activities to coordinate observations involving more than one messenger.</li>
<li>Observations: Observations of astrophysical objects or phenomena that are potentially sources of more than one messenger.</li>
<li>Interpretation: Theory, experiment, simulations and other activities to understand or interpret observations of astrophysical objects that are sources of more than onemessenger.</li>
</ul>

Competitive proposals will accelerate the progress in multi-messenger astrophysics and advance the community activities that have been developed during the initial five-year period of the WoU-MMA program. These build on observational and analysis capabilities at the intersection of the explorations enabled by each of the three windows. Efforts to integrate research communities to develop full interoperability between the three windows, and to develop a skilled new workforce in this field, are also encouraged. Proposals should be submitted to the relevant programs listed below (see Related Programs).


The WoU-MMA program is not intended to replace existing programs that make awards that involve experimental or theoretical efforts related to each of the three messengers. Rather, the WoU-MMA program is meant to fund awards that have significant components of multi-messenger astrophysics. Priority will be given to proposals for dedicated efforts that significantly advance the WoU-MMA goals. A proposal that is requesting consideration within the context of WoU-MMA should begin the title with the identifying acronym "WoU-MMA:". PIs should ask for consideration and review as a WoU-MMA proposal only if the proposal addresses at least one of the criteria listed above. Proposals marked for consideration by the WoU-MMA program that do not address at least one of these criteria will be reviewed solely within the participating program(s) to which they were submitted. Supplement requests to existing awards within a program that address one of the above criteria will also be considered.",NULL,7,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,"[{"applicant_type_id": 8, "applicant_type_name": "Unrestricted (i.e., open to any type of entity above), subject to any clarification in text field entitled \"Additional Information on Eligibility\""}]"

The goals of the Catalysis program are to increase fundamental understanding in catalytic engineering science and to advance the development of catalysts and catalytic reactions that are beneficial to society. Research should focus on critical challenges and opportunities in both new and proven catalysis technologies. Areas of emphasis may include novel catalyst compositions, structures, operating environment, data science tools, theory, and modeling &ndash; preferably in various combinations as dictated by the specific reaction and related knowledge and technology gaps. Target applications include fuels, specialty and bulk chemicals, environmental catalysis, biomass conversion to fuels and chemicals, greenhouse gas mitigation, recycling of waste materials, generation of solar hydrogen, as well as efficient routes to energy utilization.


Heterogeneous catalysis represents the main thrust of the program. Proposals related to both gas-solid and liquid-solid heterogeneous catalysis are welcome, as are proposals that incorporate concepts from homogeneous catalysis. Recent research trends have highlighted the need for evaluation of catalyst performance and properties under working conditions, especially as supported by advanced in situ and in operando characterization methods. Catalyst synthesizability and stability present additional research opportunities given the harsh operating environments of many catalytic processes. 


Topic areas of particular interest include:

<ul>
<li>Energy-related catalysis, utilizing renewable or sustainable energy in lieu of thermal, fossil fuel-based technologies, especially applications in electrocatalysis, photocatalysis, and catalytic conversion of biomass-derived chemicals, and also including fuel cell catalysis.</li>
<li>Catalysis aimed at closing the carbon cycle (especially conversion of carbon dioxide, methane, and natural gas to fuels and chemical intermediates).</li>
<li>Heterogeneous catalytic alternatives to traditionally non-catalytic or homogeneous reaction processes, as well as new catalyst designs for established catalytic processes.</li>
<li>Environmental catalysis focused on mitigating both air and water pollutants, and supporting energy-efficient upcycling of waste materials to higher-value products.</li>
<li>Catalytic remediation of feedstocks, process streams, products, or effluents.</li>
<li>Commercially scalable methods of catalyst synthesis, including durable, poison-resistant, and easily regenerable catalyst formulations and designs.</li>
<li>New catalytic materials and architectures (especially those substituting earth-abundant materials for precious and noble metal catalysts).</li>
<li>Basic understanding of catalytic materials, reaction pathways, kinetics, and surface reaction mechanisms.</li>
<li>Advanced tools for catalyst characterization and theoretical/computational catalysis.</li>
</ul>

Proposals that deal with new catalytic materials, especially when viewed in light of the inherent complexity of heterogeneous catalytic reactions, will be enhanced by including plans to assess: 1) reproducibility and repeatability of data, 2) stability under realistic operating conditions including start-up and shut-down cycles, 3) performance relative to standard or well-known reference materials, and 4) quantitative, well-accepted measures of catalyst activity, selectivity, and catalytic efficiency, such as turnover frequencies, quantum and/or photon yields of photocatalysts, Faradaic efficiency of electrocatalytic reactions, and detailed product analyses and mass balances for the targeted application.


NOTE: Proposals that focus on 1) molecular or homogeneous catalysis, 2) the surface science of catalysis, 3) photo redox catalysis, 4) catalytic organic synthesis reactions, and/or 5) fine chemical synthesis and pharmaceutical applications of catalysis may be more appropriately submitted to the Chemical Catalysis program.(CHE 6884) in the Division of Chemistry in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences. Proposals focused on biocatalytic processes, including proposals focusing on enzyme engineering, cellular and biomolecular processes, should be submitted to the Cellular and Biochemical Engineering program (CBET 1491). If the proposal focuses on reaction engineering aspects of catalytic processes, submit to the Process Systems, Reaction Engineering, and Molecular Thermodynamics program (CBET 1403). Projects that are interdisciplinary in nature may be jointly funded with other CBET and NSF programs. Program directors will review the submissions and may transfer your proposal to give it the best review situation.


Innovative proposals outside of these specific interest areas may be considered. However, prior to submission, it is recommended that the Principal Investigator contact the program director to avoid the possibility of the proposal being returned without review.

TheCellular and Biochemical Engineering(CBE)program is part of theEngineering Biology and Healthcluster, which also includes: 1) theBiophotonicsprogram; 2) theBiosensingprogram; 3) theDisability and Rehabilitation Engineeringprogram; and 4) theEngineering of Biomedical Systemsprogram.


TheCellular and Biochemical Engineeringprogram supports fundamental engineering research that advances understanding of cellular andbiomolecular processes. CBE-funded research may lead to the development of enabling technology for advanced biomanufacturing of therapeutic cells, biochemicals, and biopharmaceuticals, and for otherbiotechnology industrie.


The program encourages highly innovative and potentially transformative engineering research leading to novel bioprocessing and biomanufacturing approaches. Fundamental to many CBE research projects is the understanding of how biomolecules, subcellular systems, cells, and cell populations interact, and how those interactions lead to changes in structure, function, and behavior. A quantitative treatment of problems related to biological processes is considered vital to successful research projects in the CBE program.


Major areas of interest for the program include:

<ul type="disc">
<li>Metabolic engineering and synthetic biology for biomanufacturing,</li>
<li>The design of synthetic metabolic components and synthetic cells,</li>
<li>Microbiome structure, function, maintenance, and design,</li>
<li>Protein and enzyme engineering, and</li>
<li>Design of integrated chemoenzymatic systems.</li>
</ul>

The CBE program also encourages proposals that effectively integrate knowledge and practices from different disciplines while incorporating ongoing research into educational activities.


All proposals should include a description on the potential impact of proposed research on an associated biomanufacturing process.

The goal of theEngineering of Biomedical Systems(EBMS) program is to provide opportunities for fundamental and transformative research projects that integrate engineering and life sciences to solve biomedical problems and serve humanity in the long term. Projects are expected to use an engineering framework (for example, design or modeling) that supports increased understanding of physiological or pathophysiological processes. Projects must include objectives that advance both engineering and biomedical sciences.


Projects may include: methods, models, and enabling tools applied to understand or control living systems; fundamental improvements in deriving information from cells, tissues, organs, and organ systems; or new approaches to the design of systems that include both living and non-living components for eventual medical use in the long term.


TheEBMS programsupports fundamental and transformative research in the following areas of biomedical engineering:

<ul type="disc">
<li>Developmentof validated models (living or computational) of healthy and pathological tissues and organ systems that can support improved fundamental understanding of these systems or that could be applied in the future for development and testing of medical interventions;</li>
<li>Designand validation of systems that integrate living and non-living componentsfor improved understanding of physiology that could be applied in the future for diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment ofdisease or injury;</li>
<li>Design and subsequent application of technologies andtools toinvestigate fundamental physiological and pathophysiological processes;</li>
<li>Advancedbiomanufacturing of three-dimensional tissues and organs; and</li>
<li>Application of engineering tools and principles, including mathematical modeling, to quantitatively study the immune system in health and disease and to develop techniques for controlling and modulating a host&rsquo;s immune response to challenges such as infectious diseases, cancer, implants, autoimmune disorders, wounds, etc.</li>
</ul>

The long-term impact of the projects can be related to effective disease diagnosis and/or treatment, or improved health care delivery. However, immediate goals should focus on improved fundamental understanding of cell and tissue function in normal or pathological conditions and advancing biomedical engineering.


Innovative proposals outside of these specific areas of biomedical engineering may be considered.However, prior to submission, it is strongly recommended that the PIs contact the program director to avoid the possibility of the proposal being returned without review. Related programs also fund biomedical engineering research, and PIs are encouraged to examine these to find the appropriate program for submission.


The EBMS program does not support proposals having as their central theme drug design and delivery, the development of biomedical devices that do not include a living biological component, or thedevelopment of animal models of disease.For consideration by the EBMS program, proposals that advance the design of tools or technologies should also apply those technologies to advance knowledge in biomedical science. NSF does not support clinical trials; however, feasibility studies involving human volunteers may be supported if appropriate to the project objectives.


Projects with a central focus on design or optimization of a device, material, algorithm, or process alone without exploring new fundamental biomedical science are not appropriate for the EBMS program. Furthermore, although research on biomaterials, cellular biomechanics, manufacturing systems, or algorithm/device design may constitute a part of the proposed studies, such research can be more appropriately targeted to other NSF programs:

<ul>
<li>Projects that aim to improve protein engineering or cellular biomanufacturing - either manufacturing cells or cell-derived products - should consider the Cellular and Biochemical Engineering (CBE) program.</li>
<li>Projects that focus on the development and application of microphysiological systems that model functional recovery related to a specific human disability or injury mechanism should consider the Disability and Rehabilitation Engineering (DARE) program.</li>
<li>Biomaterials-focused projects should consider the Biomaterials (BMAT) program in the Division of Materials Research (DMR).</li>
<li>Cellular and tissue biomechanics projects should consider the Biomechanics and Mechanobiology (BMMB) program in the Division of Civil, Mechanical, and Manufacturing Innovation (CMMI).</li>
<li>Manufacturing systems proposals should consider the Advanced Manufacturing(AM) program in the Division of Civil, Mechanical, and Manufacturing Innovation (CMMI).</li>
<li>Innovative research on signal processing techniques or dynamic biosensing systems should consider the Communications, Circuits, and Sensing-Systems (CCSS) program in the Division of Electrical, Communications and Cyber Systems (ECCS).</li>
<li>Innovative research on novel devices based on the principles of electronics, optics and photonics, optoelectronics, magnetics, opto- and electromechanics, electromagnetics, and related physical phenomena, also including material-device interaction, should consider the Electronics, Photonics and Magnetic Devices (EPMD) Program in the Division of Electrical, Communications and Cyber Systems (ECCS).</li>

The Disability and Rehabilitation Engineering program supports fundamental engineering research that will improve the quality of life of persons with disabilities through the development of new theories, methodologies, technologies, or devices. Disabilities could be developmental, cognitive, hearing, mobility, visual, selfcare, independent living, or other. Proposed projects must advance knowledge regarding a specific human disability or pathological motion or understanding of injury mechanisms.


Research may be supported that is directed toward the characterization, restoration, rehabilitation, and/or substitution of human functional ability or cognition, or to the interaction between persons with disabilities and their environment. Areas of particular interest are neuroengineering, rehabilitation robotics, brain-inspired assistive or rehabilitative systems, theoretical or computational methods, and novel models of functional recovery including the development and application of artificial physiological systems.


Emphasis is placed on significant advancement of fundamental engineering knowledge that facilitates transformative outcomes. The DARE Program encourages high-risk/high-reward proposals that surpass incremental technological improvements. The DARE Program also encourages participatory design and the inclusion of trainees with disabilities as part of the proposed research or broader impacts.


Innovative proposals outside of the above specific interest areas may be considered. However, prior to submission, it is recommended that the PI contact the Program Director to avoid the possibility of the proposal being returned without review.


NSF does not support clinical trials; however, feasibility studies involving human volunteers may be supported if appropriate to the project objectives. The development and application of artificial physiological systems that do not model functional recovery and instead improve fundamental understanding of physiological and pathophysiological processes would be appropriate for EBMS.


Furthermore, the DARE program does not support proposals having as their central theme commercialization of a product. Small businesses seeking early stage R&amp;D funding for product development are encouraged to contact the NSF SBIR/STTR program in the America's Seed Fund within the Directorate for Technology, Innovation and Partnerships (TIP).

CREST Center awards promote the development of new knowledge, enhancements of the research productivity of individual faculty, and an expanded presence of students historically underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines.


Successful CREST Center proposals will demonstrate a clear vision and integration of STEM research and education and will align with the mission of the Division of Equity for Excellence in STEM (EES) with respect to the development of a diverse STEM workforce. CREST Centers are also expected to provide leadership by meaningfully involving the efforts of those faculty, students, and postdoctoral researchers who are traditionally underrepresented in STEM at all levels. Centers are required to use evidence-based and innovative strategies to address salient broadening participation and workforce development issues, such as recruitment, retention, and mentorship of participants from underrepresented groups. Successful proposals are expected to achieve national research competitiveness, broaden participation in STEM, and generate sustained, non-CREST funding from federal, state, and/or private-sector sources.


PhaseI and Phase II CREST Center Awards


Preliminary proposals are required for Phase I and Phase II projects. Thus, an invitation from NSF must be received before submitting a full proposal. Both Phase I and Phase II CREST Center awards provide multi-year support for institutions that demonstrate a strong research base. Phase I CREST Center awards provide funding for five years of research on a specific NSF-supported topic. If invited, institutions may submit a Phase II CREST Center proposal requesting funding to continue research in the same disciplinary area as the Phase I Center or may submit a Phase I proposal focused on a disciplinary area that is significantly different from those of the previous award(s).


CREST Partnership Supplements


CREST Partnership Supplemental funding requests are invited from current CREST Center awardees. Supplements support the establishment or strengthening of partnerships and collaborations with active CREST Centers and other nationally or internationally recognized research centers (including NSF-supported research centers), private sector research laboratories, K-12 schools, and/or informal science entities, including museums and science centers, as appropriate.

HNDS research will identify ways in which dynamic, distributed, or heterogeneous data can provide novel answers to fundamental questions about individual or group behavior. HNDS is especially interested in proposals that provide data-rich insights about human networks to support improved health, prosperity, and security.


HNDS has two tracks:


(1) Human Networks and Data Science &ndash; Infrastructure (HNDS-I). Infrastructure proposals will address the development of data resources and relevant analytic techniques that support fundamental Social, Behavioral and Economic (SBE) research. Successful infrastructure proposals will construct, within the financial resources provided by the award, databases or relevant analytic techniques and produce a finished product that will enable previously impossible data-intensive research in the social sciences. The databases or techniques should have significant impacts, either across multiple fields or within broad disciplinary areas, by making possible new types of data-intensive research in the SBE sciences.


(2) Human Networks and Data Science &ndash; Core Research (HNDS-R). Core research proposals will advance theory in a core SBE discipline by the application of data and network science methods. This includes the leveraging of large data sets with diverse spatio-temporal scales of measurement and linked qualitative and quantitative approaches, as well as multi-scale, multi-level network data and techniques of network analysis. Supported projects are expected to yield results that will enhance, expand, and transform theory and methods, and that generate novel understandings of human behavior &ndash; particularly understandings that can lead to significant societal benefits or opportunities.

Society's overwhelming reliance on cyberspace, however, has exposed the system's fragility and vulnerabilities: corporations, agencies, national infrastructure, and individuals continue to suffer cyber-attacks. Achieving a truly secure cyberspace requires addressing both challenging scientific and engineering problems involving many components of a system, and vulnerabilities that stem from human behaviors and choices. Examining the fundamentals of security and privacy as a multidisciplinary subject can lead to fundamentally new ways to design, build, and operate cyber systems, protect existing infrastructure, and motivate individuals to learn about cybersecurity. The Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2014, as amended by the National Defense Authorization Acts for 2018 and 2021, and the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022, authorizes the National Science Foundation (NSF), in coordination with the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), to offer a scholarship program to recruit and train the next generation of cybersecurity professionals to meet the needs of the cybersecurity mission of federal, state, local, and tribal governments. The goals of the CyberCorps&reg; Scholarship for Service (SFS) program are aligned with the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/National-Cybersecurity-Strategy-2023.pdf">U.S. strategy</a> to develop a superior cybersecurity workforce. The program goals are to: (1) increase the number of qualified and diverse cybersecurity candidates for government cybersecurity positions; (2) improve the national capacity for the education of cybersecurity professionals and research and development workforce; (3) hire, monitor, and retain high-quality CyberCorps&reg; graduates in the cybersecurity mission of the Federal Government; and (4) strengthen partnerships between institutions of higher education and federal, state, local, and tribal governments. While all three agencies work together on all four goals, NSF&rsquo;s strength is in the first two goals; OPM&rsquo;s in goal (3); and DHS in goal (4).


The SFS Program welcomes proposals to establish or to continue scholarship programs in cybersecurity. A proposing institution must provide clearly documented evidence of a strong existing academic program in cybersecurity. In addition to information provided in the proposal narrative, such evidence can include ABET accreditation in cybersecurity; a designation by the National Security Agency and the Department of Homeland Security as a Center of Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense Education(CAE-CDE), in Cyber Operations (CAE-CO) or in Research (CAE-R); or equivalent evidence documenting a strong program in cybersecurity.


Service Obligation: All scholarship recipients must work after graduation in the cybersecurity mission of a federal, state, local, or tribal government organization, or certain other qualifying entities, for a period equal to at least the length of the scholarship.


The SFS Program also supports efforts leading to an increase in the ability of the United States higher education enterprise to produce cybersecurity professionals.

The goal of theEnvironmental Sustainabilityprogram is to promote sustainable engineered systems that support human well-being and that are also compatible with sustaining natural (environmental) systems. These systems provide ecological services vital for human survival. Research efforts supported by the program typically consider long time horizons and may incorporate contributions from the social sciences and ethics. The program supports engineering research that seeks to balance society's need to provide ecological protection and maintain stable economic conditions.


There are five principal general research areas that are supported.

<ul type="disc">
<li>Circular Bioeconomy Engineering:This area includes research that enables sustainable societal use of food, energy, water, nitrogen, phosphorus, and materials, with the reduction and eventual elimination of fossil fuel combustion that lacks carbon capture. The program encourages research that helps build the raw material basis for the functioning of society principally on biomass, drawing heavily on sustainable agriculture and forestry. Additionally, material flows must reduce or preferably eliminate waste, with an emphasis on closed-loop or &ldquo;circular&rdquo; processing.</li>
<li>Industrial ecology:Topics of interest include advancements in modeling such as life cycle assessment, materials flow analysis, net energy analysis, input/output economic models, and novel metrics for measuring sustainable systems. Innovations in industrial ecology are encouraged.</li>
<li>Green engineering:Research is encouraged to advance the sustainability of manufacturing processes, green buildings, and infrastructure. Many programs in the Engineering Directorate support research in environmentally benign manufacturing or chemical processes. The Environmental Sustainability program supports research that would affect more than one chemical or manufacturing process or that takes a systems or holistic approach to green engineering for infrastructure or green buildings. Improvements in distribution and collection systems that will advance smart growth strategies and ameliorate effects of growth are research areas that are supported by Environmental Sustainability. Innovations in management of storm water, recycling and reuse of drinking water, and other green engineering techniques to support sustainability may also be fruitful areas for research.</li>
<li>Ecological engineering:Proposals should focus on the engineering aspects of restoring ecological function to natural systems. Engineering research in the enhancement of natural capital to foster sustainable development is encouraged.</li>
<li>Earth systems engineering:Earth systems engineering considers aspects of large-scale engineering research that involve mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions, adaptation to climate change, and other global concerns.</li>

TheFluid Dynamicsprogram supports fundamental research toward gaining an understanding of the physics of various fluid dynamics phenomena. Proposed research should contribute to basic scientific understanding via experiments, theoretical developments, and computational discovery.


Major areas of interest and activity in the program include:

<ul type="disc">
<li>Turbulence and transition: High Reynolds number experiments; large eddy simulation; direct numerical simulation; transition to turbulence; 3-D boundary layers; separated flows; multi-phase turbulent flows; flow control and drag reduction. High-speed boundary layer transition and turbulence at Mach numbers greater than 5 to understand modal and/or non-modal interactions leading to boundary layer transition and the ensuing developing and fully developed turbulent boundary layer flows.Combined experiments and simulations are encouraged.</li>
<li>Bio-fluid physics:Bio-inspired flows; biological flows with emphasis on flow physics.</li>
<li>Non-Newtonian fluid mechanics:Single-phase viscoelastic flows; solutions of macro-molecules.</li>
<li>Bubble dynamics: Bubbles related to cavitation and/or drag reduction or impacting the fluid viscosity (locally) or manipulation of bubbles with external excitation (acoustofluidics).</li>
<li>Microfluidics and nanofluidics: Micro-and nano-scale flow physics.</li>
<li>Wind and ocean energy harvesting: Focused on fundamental fluid dynamics associated with renewable energy. The NSF-DOE (Department of Energy) joint funding area is focused on high Reynolds number aerodynamics of thick airfoils (&gt; 21% thickness/chord) operating in complex (3D) steady, unsteady, and separated flows. Impacts of blade surface quality/roughness rotor performance on the aerodynamic/aeroelastic performance of novel rotor geometries and supporting structures are also of interest. Air/sea interactions, including waves/currents, on the hydrodynamic loading for offshore wind turbines. Improved measurement techniques and sensing/control technologies required to characterize the metocean environment impact on performance. The DoE participates in this initiative throughthe Wind Energy Technologies Office (program manager Michael Derby, email: michael.derby@ee.doe.gov).</li>
<li>Fluid-structure interactions:General FSI applications across the low- to high-Reynolds number range are of interest to NSF. In addition, NSF-AFOSR (Air Force Office of Scientific Research) joint funding area is focused on theory, modeling and/or experiments for hypersonic applications. AFOSR participates in this initiative through the Aerothermodynamics program.</li>
<li>Canonicalconfigurations:Experimental research is encouraged to develop spatiotemporally resolveddatabases for canonical configurations to either confirm historicalresults or to provide data in an unexplored parameter region. Fidelity and completeness for theoretical/computational validation is a key attribute of theproposed experimental data.</li>
<li>Artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning:Innovative AI ideas related to the use of machine learning and other AI approaches in fluid dynamics research to model and control the flows are encouraged.Verifying new models with canonicalconfigurations, when appropriate, is encouraged for theComputational andData-Enabled Science &amp; Engineering(CDS&amp;E) program.</li>
<li>Instrumentation and Flow Diagnostics: Instrument development for time-space resolvedmeasurements; shear stress sensors; novel flow imaging; and velocimetry.</li>
</ul>

NOTE:Proposals that use fluid flows as a boundary input condition or a driving force in a problem do not fit within the scope of this program. Proposals focused on particulates (including droplets) two-way coupled with fluids, colloids, and multiphase rheology and processes should be directed to the Particulate andMultiphase Processesprogram. Proposals dealing mainly with materials synthesis, processing and characterization may be more suitable for theAdvanced Manufacturingprogramin the Division of Civil, Mechanical, and Manufacturing Innovation orprograms in theDivision of Materials Research. Proposals dealing primarily with sensors and controls may be more suitable for the Dynamics, Controls, &amp; Cognition program in the Division of Civil, Mechanical, and Manufacturing Innovation. Proposals focused on biological systems may be more suitable forPhysiological and Structural Systemsin the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems.

NSF promotes the progress of science by maintaining the general health of research and education across all fields of science and engineering. The Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences (SBE) Directorate within NSF supports basic research on people and society. The SBE sciences focus on human behavior and social organizations; how social, economic, political, cultural and environmental forces affect the lives of people from birth to old age; and how people in turn shape those forces. SBE's <a href="https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/science-science-discovery-communication-impact">Science of Science: Discovery, Communication and Impact Program (SoS:DCI)</a> supports research designed to advance the scientific basis of science and innovation policy.


The NIH is the U.S. federal agency charged with supporting biomedical research in the U.S.The National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) within the NIH supports basic biomedical research that increases understanding of biological processes and lays the foundation for advances in disease diagnosis, treatment and prevention.


Both NSF and NIH believe that there are opportunities and needs for building and supporting research projects with a focus on the scientific research enterprise. The two agencies also recognize that when programmatic goals are compatible, coordinated management and funding of a research program can have a positive synergistic effect on the level and scope of research and can leverage the investments of both agencies.


Therefore, NIGMS and SBE are partnering to enable collaboration in research between theSoS:DCI program and NIGMS. This partnership will result in a portfolio of high-quality research to provide scientific analysis of important aspects of the biomedical research enterprise and efforts to foster a diverse, innovative, productive and efficient scientific workforce, from which future scientific leaders will emerge.


Prospective investigators are strongly encouraged to discuss theirproposals with the program officers before submission to determine project relevance to the priorities of both SBE and NIGMS.

The research enterprise, broadly defined, includes research development and administration, research analytics, technology transfer and commercialization, corporate relations/public-private partnerships, research integrity, compliance and security, research policy, administration of student research training, and research leadership. Strengthening and transforming this administrative infrastructure is necessary to fully utilize the Nation's research talent and capabilities and empower America's organizations that engage in or support research and its outcomes, to participate in a globally competitive research enterprise.


Program Description


Maintaining U.S. global leadership demands a research enterprise that is competitive, effective, sustainable <span>a</span>nd contributes to the Nation's economic growth goals. A strong national research enterprise relies on more than funding for the research itself. It also requires robust administrative support-and-service infrastructure, which is often unseen, yet includes critical components to ensure a competitive research environment regardless of organization or location. Research enterprise infrastructure enables the development of proposals and management of awards and supports research translation through technology transfer and public-private partnerships. Research compliance enables the security and integrity of research approaches. Research analytics and communication, managing the training of the U.S. scientific workforce, and harnessing the creativity and drive of research leadership, and more, are also fundamental components of the infrastructure.


The<a href="https://new.nsf.gov/funding/initiatives/broadening-participation/granted">GRANTED initiative</a>provides unique opportunities to realize a broad and collaborative vision for research enterprise infrastructure. Proposals in response to this GRANTED program description should engage the professional, administrative research support-and-service workforce in project leadership roles described within proposals.Proposed projects should look beyond individual and discipline-specific research needs and focus on activities that create organization-wide impact and potential for regional and national impact.

An announcement is not related to this notice. The U.S. State Department’ s Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons (TIP Office) is not accepting applications at this time.  Please review the attached notice for full details. 

Background:

The goal of PEMS is to measurably and substantially reduce the prevalence of human trafficking in targeted populations in partner countries and jurisdictions through innovative interventions driven by research, monitoring, evaluation, and learning, and the expansion of partnerships. PEMS-funded efforts conduct scientifically rigorous research to establish evidence on the effects of anti-trafficking programs on the reduction of the prevalence of human trafficking through the advancement of rigorous research methods.  This includes sound prevalence measurement; strong monitoring and evaluation practices; evidence-based programming; and the application of survivor-centered and trauma-informed approaches.  The U.S. Congress has appropriated $25 million annually since Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 for PEMS, totaling $200 million to date.

The TIP Office is interested in funding projects that utilize Intervention Development Research (IDR) to conduct research and pilot targeted programming to effectively prevent and respond to human trafficking.  IDR employs various qualitative and quantitative methodologies to identify the complex systems in which human trafficking occurs, determine modifiable elements of the crime, including risk and protective factors; develop a theory of change; and design and pilot interventions to develop an intervention model that can be scaled-up and/or adapted for other settings.  Local partnerships and utilization of methods of co-creation and participatory research are core elements of IDR.  Local actors must play an active role in all phases of the project, from planning and development through implementation of the intervention.

The ultimate vision of the legislation governing the S-STEM parent program[1] (and of the current S-STEM-Net solicitation) is that all Americans, regardless of economic status, should be able to contribute to the American innovation economy if they so desire.


To support collaboration within the S-STEM network, NSF will fund several S-STEM Research Hubs (S-STEM-Hub). The S-STEM Network(S-STEM-Net) will collaborate to create synergies and sustain a robust national ecosystem consisting of multi-sector partners supporting domestic low-income STEM students in achieving their career goals, while also ensuring access, inclusion, and adaptability to changing learning needs. The Hubs will investigate evolving barriers to the success of this student population. It will also disseminate the context and circumstances by which interventions and practices that support graduation of domestic low-income students (both undergraduate and graduate) pursuing careers in STEM are successful.


The target audience for this dissemination effort is the community of higher education institutions, faculty, scholars, researchers and evaluators, local and regional organizations, industry, and other nonprofit, federal, state, and local agencies concerned with the success of domestic low-income STEM students in the United States.

Cooperative agreements to CESU network participants residing in CESU network regions other than those listed above will be pursued separate from this notice of funding opportunity; however, those CESU network participants may still apply for a Master Cooperative Agreement under this announcement.  Application instructions are found in Section D. Application and Submission Information. 


Applications will be reviewed and evaluated as they are received and may be submitted at any time up until the closing date of this announcement. 


The Cooperative Ecosystem Studies Units network is a national consortium of Federal agencies, tribes, academic institutions, state and local governments, nongovernmental conservation organizations, and other partners working together to support informed public trust resource stewardship. The CESU network includes 390 non-Federal partners and 15 Federal Agencies in seventeen (17) CESUs  representing biogeographic regions encompassing all 50 states and U.S. territories. The CESU network is well positioned as a platform to support research, technical assistance, education and capacity building that is responsive to long-standing and contemporary science and resource management priorities.

The seventeen (17) CESUs bring together scientists, resource managers, students, and other conservation professionals, drawing upon expertise from across the biological, physical, social, cultural, and engineering disciplines (from Anthropology to Zoology) to conduct collaborative and interdisciplinary applied projects that address natural and cultural heritage resource issues at multiple scales and in an ecosystem context. Each CESU is structured as a working collaborative with participation from numerous Federal and non-Federal institutional partners. CESUs are based at host universities and focused on a particular biogeographic region of the country.
The NPS is required under “Research Mandate” 54 USC 100702 to ensure the management of NPS units are “enhanced by the availability and utilization of a broad program of the highest quality science and information.”  To help answer this mandate, the NPS works cooperatively with approved CESU cooperators.  Annually the NPS obligates between $30M and $40M in CESU cooperative agreements agency wide.  Individual projects are up to five (5) years in duration with an average of approximately $60,000 per agreement.

The NPS plans to create Master Cooperative Agreements with CESU partners to carry out the CFDA program 15.945, Cooperative Research and Training Programs – Resources of the National Park System.  The NPS is announcing the intent to solicit proposals from organizations within the CESU network.  The objectives of the CESU program are:

a. Provide usable knowledge to support informed decision making.

b. Ensure the independence and objectivity of research.

c. Create and maintain effective partnerships among the Federal agencies and universities to share resources and expertise.

d. Take full advantage of university resources while benefiting faculty and students.

e. Encourage professional development of current and future Federal scientists, resource managers, and environmental leaders.

f. Manage Federal resources effectively.",NULL,62,1,0.00,0.00,NULL,"[{"applicant_type_id": 1, "applicant_type_name": "Others (see text field entitled \"Additional Information on Eligibility\" for clarification)"}]"

An MRI award supports the acquisition of a multi-user research instrument that is commercially available through direct purchase from a vendor, or for the personnel costs and equipment that are required for the development of an instrument with new capabilities, thereby advancing instrumentation capabilities and enhancing expertise for instrument design and fabrication at academic institutions. MRI instruments are, in general, too costly and/or not appropriate for support through other NSF programs.


MRI provides support to acquire critical research instrumentation without which advances in fundamental science and engineering research may not otherwise occur. MRI also provides support to obtain next-generation research instruments by developing instruments with new capabilities that open new opportunities to advance the frontiers in science and engineering research. Additionally, an MRI award is expected to enhance research training of students who will become the next generation of instrument users, designers and builders.


An MRI proposal may request from NSF up to $4 million for either acquisition or development of a research instrument. Each performing organization may submit in revised "Tracks" as defined below, with no more than two (2) submissions in Track 1 and no more than one (1) submission in Track 2. For the newly defined Track 3, no more than one (1) submission per competition is permitted.  As a result, it is now possible for an institution to submit up to four MRI proposals within the Track limits as described above.<br />

<ul>
<li>Track 1: Track 1 MRI proposals are those that request funds from NSF greater than $100,000<sup><a title="" name="_ftnref1" href="#_ftn1">[1]</a></sup> and less than $1,400,000.</li>
<li>Track 2: Track 2 MRI proposals are those that request funds from NSF greater than or equal to $1,400,000 up to and including $4,000,000.</li>
<li>Track 3: Track 3 MRI proposals are those that request funds from NSF greater than or equal to $100,000<sup>[1]</sup> and less than or equal to $4,000,000 that include the purchase, installation, operation, and maintenance of equipment and instrumentation to conserve or reduce the consumption of helium. Institutions may submit no more than one Track 3 proposal. Submission of a Track 3 proposal does not impact limits that apply for Track 1 and Track 2 proposals.</li>
</ul>

Cost sharing requirements for new awards in the MRI Program are waived for a period of 5 years beginning with the FY 2023 MRI competition. Institutional submission limits for Track 1, Track 2 and Track 3 proposals remain.


The MRI Program especially seeks broad representation of groups, institutions, and geographic regions that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines. Proposals from women, underrepresented minorities, persons with disabilities and early-career PIs are encouraged, as are proposals that benefit early-career researchers and proposals with PIs from geographically underserved regions, including EPSCoR jurisdictions. Additionally, proposals are encouraged from under-resourced institutions, including from emerging research institutions, where MRI can significantly build capacity for research.

<p>TACTICAL BEHAVIORS FOR AUTONOMOUS MANEUVER COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH PROGRAM (TBAM-CRP)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Future Army forces will be called upon to operate and maneuver in multi-domain</p>
<p>operations (MDO), against a modern and capable peer adversary. The battlefield of the future</p>
<p>may impose additional constraints on maneuver forces such as disruption in communication as</p>
<p>well as positioning services. To field a highly capable fighting force in this future battlefield,</p>
<p>novel tactics and doctrines leveraging nascent technologies in robotics and autonomous systems</p>
<p>(RAS) will need to be developed. Teams of RAS will serve an increasingly critical role in the</p>
<p>future force to deliver situational awareness, defend key locations or positions, or take point in</p>
<p>dynamic and hazardous situations. Resilience to disruptions, failures, or unexpected scenarios, is</p>
<p>a key quality for teams of RAS to operate alongside other future Army forces. The US Army</p>
<p>Combat Capabilities Development Command (DEVCOM) Army Research Laboratory (ARL) is</p>
<p>focused on developing fundamental understanding and informing the art-of-the-possible for</p>
<p>warfighter concepts through research to greatly improve the scope of mission capabilities of</p>
<p>teams of RAS, develop robust and resilient approaches to plan under extreme conditions of</p>
<p>uncertainty, to learn coordinated strategies for groups of agents to achieve a common objective,</p>
<p>all within a complex maneuver environment including adversaries. The Tactical Behaviors for</p>
<p>Autonomous Maneuver Collaborative Research Program (TBAM-CRP) is focused on developing</p>
<p>and experimentally evaluating coordinated and individual behaviors for small groups of</p>
<p>autonomous agents to learn doctrinal as well as novel tactics for maneuvering in military relevant</p>
<p>environments. The TBAM-CRP will leverage developments in other internal and extramural</p>
<p>programs as well as identify new research directions to find novel solutions to these maneuver</p>
<p>problems in analogical simulations representing complex realistic terrain.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Tactical Behaviors for Autonomous Maneuver Collaborative Research Program (TBAM-CRP) will</p>
<p>consist of a series of sprint efforts executed with annual program reviews. Each topic will be focused on</p>
<p>addressing a different set of scientific areas which will support the research aims of an associated ARL</p>
<p>researcher from a related internal essential research program (ERP) or mission-funded program.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The TBAM-CRP has been developed in coordination with other related ARL-funded collaborative efforts</p>
<p>(see descriptions of ARL collaborative alliances at https://www.arl.army.mil/business/collaborativealliances/)</p>
<p>and shares a common vision of highly collaborative academia-industry-government</p>
<p>partnerships; however, it will be executed with a program model adapted from the Scalable, Adaptive,</p>
<p>and Resilient Autonomy (SARA), which established a new paradigm for collaborative research. Some</p>
<p>key properties of this new approach are described below:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>• TBAM-CRP sprint topics will be offered on a two-year cycle. Proposals will be solicited for a</p>
<p>possible two-year period structured as a first-year pilot followed by a second-year option where</p>
<p>the option may be awarded based upon progress assessed at an annual review. The FOA will be</p>
<p>amended annually to identify a specific problem statement and scope for that specific cycle. The</p>
<p>topics for each cycle will be chosen to address the long-term program goal.</p>
<p>• Five new topics (Cycles 1-5) are expected in FY22, 24, 26, 28, 30. Each topic will be carefully</p>
<p>chosen based on the previous accomplishments in the prior cycle(s), the development of new</p>
<p>technologies and capabilities in the broader research and development communities, and the</p>
<p>Army’s evolving needs for future capabilities.</p>
<p>• For each topic, funding will be provided to those Recipients selected under a cooperative</p>
<p>agreement (CA).</p>
<p>• Enhanced Research Program funding from ARL or Other Government Agencies (OGAs) may</p>
<p>become available during a cycle which provides a mechanism for growth and enhancement within</p>
<p>the TBAM-CRP. A proposal should not include any discussion of the Enhanced Research</p>
<p>Program. Recipients receiving a CA will be notified and provided details if the opportunity for</p>
<p>Enhanced Research Program funding becomes available during their award period of</p>
<p>performance.</p>
<p>• There is no limitation on the place of performance, although on-site collaboration at ARL</p>
<p>facilities and with ARL researchers as well as with other Recipients are encouraged. Research</p>
<p>outcomes in this program must, at the very least, be demonstrated in sophisticated simulations of</p>
<p>relevant environments. Together with ARL collaborators, these results may be adapted for higher</p>
<p>TRL experimentation on surrogate platforms at ARL test facilities such as the Robotics Research</p>
<p>Collaboration Campus (R2C2) at Graces Quarters, Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland.</p>
<p>• Recipients will be furnished with access to the ARL Autonomy Stack software suite as well as all</p>
<p>relevant simulation tools and multi-agent learning support.</p>
<p>• Recipients will be provided with information about the current state of the Autonomous Systems</p>
<p>Enterprise (ASE) with an overview of developments in the associated collaborative research</p>
<p>alliances including Distributed and Collaborative Intelligent Systems and Technology (DCIST),</p>
<p>Scalable, Adaptive, and Resilient Autonomy (SARA), as well as internal ARL essential research</p>
<p>programs including the AI for Maneuver and Mobility (AIMM), Emerging Overmatch</p>
<p>Technologies (EOT), and Versatile Tactical Power and Propulsion (VICTOR). Capabilities</p>
<p>demonstrated in simulation should reflect significant appropriate developments. This midpoint</p>
<p>review is expected to take place as a mini symposium where Recipients can share results with</p>
<p>one another along with the ARL community to foster further collaboration.</p>
<p>• At the end of the second year, a capstone demonstration will be executed by those Recipients</p>
<p>receiving an option to their award in a set of simulated relevant environments, either those</p>
<p>environment scenarios provided by the Government and other program performers, or optionally</p>
<p>of a specific environment developed by the Recipient to exhibit their developed capability. Any</p>
<p>system level capability demonstration that can be made with the internal ARL collaborator or</p>
<p>description of capability development and program contribution can also be made at this time.</p>
<p>These system demonstrations are expected to coincide to foster further integration and adoption</p>
<p>with related internal research programs as well as partner organizations from within the</p>
<p>DEVCOM, other Army and DoD service branches and agencies, in addition to other government</p>
<p>agencies.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Proposals that follow the requirements of the FOA will be evaluated in accordance with merit-based,</p>
<p>competitive procedures. These procedures will include evaluation factors and an adjectival and color</p>
<p>rating system. A review team, consisting of a qualified group of Government scientists and managers</p>
<p>will evaluate the compliant proposals and provide the results of that evaluation to the decision-maker for</p>
<p>the Government. Relevant internal research program materials approved for public release and contact</p>
<p>information will be provided to potential proposers during introductory presentations to help facilitate</p>
<p>identification of collaboration between proposers and individual ARL researchers or internal research</p>
<p>programs. Additional connections to ARL programs can be identified during the proposal review process.</p>

Lower Atmospheric Observing Facilities


The National Science Foundation (NSF) Division of Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences (AGS)Lower Atmospheric Observing Facilities (LAOF) Program oversees a portfolio of multi-user national facilities that are sponsored by NSF for use by the geosciences research community. Program management resides within AGS in the NCAR and Facilities Section (NFS) which provides a single point for coordination of planning and resources.<br /><br />The LAOF program enables geoscience research through the provision of specialized facilities, instrumentation, and field support services necessary to carry out the scientific field work associated with investigations of a wide range of geophysical phenomena. The program is actively involved in oversight of LAOF facilities and decisions about the acquisition, operation, maintenance, upgrading and replacement of these facilities based on input from the scientific community. LAOF funding supports both the planning for scientific field programs (e.g., experimental design, operational plans, logistical support) and the deployment of NSF-sponsored facilities.


Proposals to the LAOF program are acceptedby invitation only. Please contact the FARE program director if you intend to submit a proposal to this program.

An announcement is not related to this notice. The U.S. State Department’ s Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons (TIP Office) is not accepting applications at this time.  Please review the attached notice for full details. 

Background:

The goal of the Program to End Modern Slavery (PEMS) is to measurably and substantially reduce the prevalence of human trafficking in targeted populations in partner countries and jurisdictions through innovative interventions driven by research, monitoring, evaluation, and learning, and the expansion of partnerships.  PEMS-funded efforts conduct scientifically rigorous research to establish evidence on the effects of anti-trafficking programs on the reduction of the prevalence of human trafficking through the advancement of sound prevalence measurement methodologies, strong monitoring and evaluation practices, evidence-based programming, and the application of victim-centered and trauma-informed approaches.  The U.S. Congress has appropriated $25 million annually since Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 for PEMS, totaling $150 million to date.

The TIP Office is interested in funding research and implementation projects focused on five priority areas as they relate to human trafficking: 
•	Supply Chains
•	Climate Change and Displacement
•	Public Health
•	Financial Inclusion
•	Sex Trafficking

PEMS encourages the use of partnerships with governments, academia, civil society, the private sector, other funders, and international organizations to advance the goals of the program and improve collaboration on the reduction of the prevalence of human trafficking.  The TIP Office anticipates that a Statement of Interest (SOI) will be released within the next couple of months on SAMS-Domestic and grants.gov followed by a Notification of Funding Opportunity (NOFO).",NULL,218,1,0.00,0.00,NULL,"[{"applicant_type_id": 1, "applicant_type_name": "Others (see text field entitled \"Additional Information on Eligibility\" for clarification)"}]"

Applicants will undergo an objective merit review process, and entities that successfully meet the requirements for approval will be placed on the ABU list. CDC will use this ABU list for emergencies that require federal support to effectively respond to, manage, and address identified public health threats. CDC will make funding related to this NOFO available once it has determined a public health emergency exists or is considered imminent and will be contingent upon the availability and stipulations of appropriations. CDC will provide additional guidance and information to those on the ABU list when this NOFO is funded.

Since this NOFO is designed to collect applications prior to a PHE, applicants are encouraged to submit work plans and budgets that demonstrate their ability to respond to a PHE. COVID-19 public health response plans, such as plans funded under CDC-RFA-TP18-1802 in 2020 are acceptable for this purpose. If this NOFO is funded for a specific PHE, CDC will develop supplemental guidance that outlines additional work plan and budget requirements tailored to the emergency.   
This NOFO is not a capacity-building funding mechanism, and it is not intended to create or establish new public health (PH) emergency management programs. It may be used to re- establish capacity lost or diminished because of the public health crisis. It is designed to support the surge needs of existing programs responding to a significant PHE. CDC will provide supplemental guidance to entities on the ABU list when this NOFO is activated regarding specific activities intended to address the emergency.

CDC has strong relationships with governmental PH departments, community-based organizations, and other domestic partners and supports them for planning, capacity-building, preparedness, and response to PHEs. This NOFO complements these ongoing capacity-building preparedness and response programs by providing a mechanism for CDC to rapidly mobilize and fund PH organizations for specific response needs. Applicants must describe how this funding will not duplicate or supplant other federal funding.

Upon occurrence of a PHE, CDC can rapidly fund specific applicants to accelerate public health crisis response activities such as coordinating emergency operations, hiring surge staff, and conducting needs assessments to determine the resources necessary to address the public health crisis. The NOFO also provides funding for specialized public health emergency response activities tailored to the specific public health crisis.","{'id': 1015, 'opportunityId': 337086, 'docUrl': 'https://www.grants.gov', 'description': 'www.grants.gov', 'createdDate': 'Jul 27, 2023 02:08:37 PM EDT'}",497,1,5000000.00,50000.00,500000000.00,"[{"applicant_type_id": 1, "applicant_type_name": "Others (see text field entitled \"Additional Information on Eligibility\" for clarification)"}, {"applicant_type_id": 4, "applicant_type_name": "Native American tribal governments (Federally recognized)"}, {"applicant_type_id": 6, "applicant_type_name": "City or township governments"}, {"applicant_type_id": 3, "applicant_type_name": "County governments"}, {"applicant_type_id": 12, "applicant_type_name": "State governments"}, {"applicant_type_id": 15, "applicant_type_name": "Special district governments"}]"

<div class="WordSection1">

TCUP supports transformative capacity-building, community engagement, or research projects at TCUP-eligible institutions through the following funding tracks:


Instructional Capacity Excellence in TCUP Institutions (ICE-TI) projects provide support to design, implement, and assess comprehensive institutional improvements in STEM education and research capacity at TCUP-eligible institutions of higher education. By strengthening STEM education and STEM education research, successful projects will increase the number of STEM students and improve the quality of their preparation. ICE-TI projects create and/or adapt and assess innovative models and materials for teaching and learning in STEM, embody knowledge about how students learn most effectively in STEM teaching and learning activities, and bring STEM disciplinary advances into the undergraduate or graduate experience. The objective of this strand is to expand STEM degrees offered by TCUP-eligible institutions or significantly enhance instructional approaches.


Targeted STEM Infusion Projects (TSIP) support the attainment of a short-term, well-defined goal to improve the quality of STEM education at an eligible institution. Targeted STEM Infusion Projects could, for example, enhance academic infrastructure by systematically adding traditional knowledge to the scope or content of a STEM course, updating curricula, modernizing laboratory research equipment, developing and delivering professional development for K-12 STEM educators, or improving the computational infrastructure.The objective of this strand is to expand STEM degrees or significantly enhance instructional approaches.


TCUP for Secondary &amp; Elementary Teachers in STEM (TSETS) supports in-service professional development in STEM disciplinary or STEM education content and/or research for K-12 STEM teachers in the relevant service area. Examples of project activities include, but are not limited to, professional development involving seminar series and engagement in STEM instruction and content during the academic year, structured series of summer intensive workshops and trainings, and summer research opportunities. The objective of this strand is to broaden the instructional capacity for STEM in the K-12 workforce and thereby to the entire community, and to build the capacity for STEM disciplinary or education research among participating educational professionals.


TCU Enterprise Advancement Centers (TEA Centers) coalesce the STEM and/or STEM education expertise into a team, designed to support and promote the STEM goals, needs, aspirations, or interests of the chartering reservation or tribe(s). TEA Centers may address a critical tribal or community need or focus on a realm of research or design that is beyond the scope of individual research grants or that is of interest to multiple tribes. The objective of this strand is to build on the capacity developed through prior TCUP support and apply expertise to collaborations with communities in the institution&rsquo;s service area, or nationally.


The Cyberinfrastructure Health, Assistance, and Improvements (CHAI) strand supports projects at TCUP-eligible institutions of higher education to upgrade the cyberinfrastructure necessary to conduct, expand, manage and administer STEM programs of study, including research. The objective of this strand is to equip TCUP institutions to meet the demands of virtual instruction, advanced computing, and data science opportunities.


Preparing for TCUP Implementation (Pre-TI) provides support for activities that prepare an institution for Implementation-level projects.Consequently, they are available only to TCUP-eligible institutions of higher education that have never received TCUP support, have not received TCUP support within the previous five years, or are embarking on a significantly novel STEM strategic plan. Examples of supported activities include completing an institutional assessment of its current STEM instructional capacity, or engaging in conversations necessary to formulate a shared vision of what that capacity should be and how to achieve it. Pre-TI awards can support staff and faculty release time, travel, stakeholder gatherings, and associated administrative costs.The objective of this strand is to conduct self-studies and formulate strategic plans for the development of STEM instructional programs of study.


The TCUP Partnerships strand provides support for collaborations that will improve TCUP institutions' instructional and research capacity in STEM fields supported by NSF; attract, retain, and support TCUP students in internships and research endeavors deemed to be necessary for a complete curriculum offering; and engage partner universities to provide an academic grounding and a successful transition for students who wish to study or attain degrees in STEM fields supported by NSF. TCUP Partnerships broaden the number of scientific disciplines available to students at TCUP institution through collaborations with non-TCUP institutions. Active Pre-Engineering Education Collaboratives or Partnerships in Geoscience Education awards are not affected by this revision. The objective of this strand is the development, through instructional and research capacity-building, of academic and career pathways for TCUP students through supporting collaborative projects between and among TCUP and non-TCUP institutions. Interested teams of collaborators for which a TCUP institution serves as lead should contact the TCUP program directors. Support for non-TCUP partners must be obtained from other NSF programs, which follows the procedures of the prior Partnership strands.


Small Grants for Research (SGR) strand support STEM or STEM Education faculty members at TCUP-eligible institutions to initiate or pursue research projects or programs that may include undergraduate or graduate student engagement. Awards are intended to help further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness; improve research and teaching at his or her home institution and create and study new models and innovations in STEM teaching and learning. International research or collaborations are strongly encouraged. TCUP students may seek support for international research opportunities under the guidance of a TCUP STEM or STEM education faculty member and an international research collaborator. These awards are particularly appropriate as a means of recruiting and retaining highly qualified scientists, engineers, and educators at TCUP-eligible institutions. The objective of this strand is to support faculty research and professional development that build research capacity at TCUP institutions.

The mission of the LQC can be captured in three broad goals: 1) pursue disruptive fundamental research and enabling technologies with a focus on qubit development for quantum computing and other applications (such as sensing); 2) grow deep, collaborative partnerships to tackle the most difficult and relevant long-term problems in quantum information science and technology; and 3) build a quantum workforce of tomorrow through research experiences in government at LPS and at LQC partners. The LQC will offer a mechanism for collaborative research between LPS and academia, industry, FFRDCs, and Government Laboratories to advance foundational and transformative research on challenging problems that have hindered progress in quantum information processing and associated technologies.</p><p><br></p><p>The goal of this BAA is to seek proposals that bring together expertise from the public and private sectors and their respective research infrastructures to advance solutions that may be best approached as a collaborative team. A Collaboratory is “a center without walls, in which the nation’s researchers can perform their research without regard to physical location, interacting with colleagues, accessing instrumentation, sharing data and computational resources, [and] accessing information in&nbsp;digital libraries.&nbsp;This BAA introduces LQC Research Thrusts (<strong>A.1.1</strong>) which are the technical areas of interest—which will be updated periodically—where partners of the LQC will pursue joint research with LPS through Incubator (<strong>A.1.2</strong>) and Collaboration (<strong>A.1.3</strong>) collaborative agreements. The LQC BAA also fulfills the Government’s overarching interest--through the proposed research and on-site research experiences--in creating and training a workforce in quantum science and technology, generating pathways of solutions that feed technology development, establishing partnerships, and creating transition opportunities. In further support of training through research, <strong>Section A.1.4</strong> calls for Quantum Computing Research (QuaCR) Graduate and Postdoctoral Fellowships for US citizens working in areas of interest.</p><p><br></p><p>Substantial progress on solving the most difficult and long-term Quantum Information Science &amp; Technology (QIST) research problems that unleash further rapid progress in the field will constitute LQC success.&nbsp;Examples of such research problems include (but are not limited to): limits of performance due to device design, material selection, and/or control, the exploration of alternative qubit physics (e.g., different approaches to qubit encoding or types of gates) and lowering of barriers to such approaches, advances in materials that improve qubit gate fidelity, reducing the overhead of classical components in quantum information technology and optimizing classical performance, and the exploration of applications of quantum technologies to new domains.</p><p><br></p><p>Three categories of proposals are sought for this BAA:</p><p><strong>1.Incubator</strong> opportunities seek partnership proposals from single investigators and small research groups, including teaching colleges, who may have unique skillsets to contribute toward the pursuit of the research thrusts presented in A.1.1.&nbsp;Incubator proposals may also be the development of concepts into a detailed technical research approach to advance solution of problems of high interest to quantum information science research.&nbsp;Incubator proposals would avail themselves of the collaboration opportunities with LPS research staff and infrastructure made available at the Laboratory for Physical Sciences (LPS) to lay the groundwork for concepts that may be suitable for a Collaboratory proposal or responses to other DoD quantum information science research opportunities.</p><p><strong>2.Collaboratory</strong> proposals seek research proposals that bring together a strong significant collaboration--researchers from academia, industry, FFRDCs, and/or Government Laboratories--to pursue long-term projects focused on fundamental problems of interest to qubit development and/or associated science and technology.&nbsp;These collaborative groups will propose to work together in a focused manner for a period of time expected to be one to three years in order to demonstrate a proof-of-concept experiment and/or theory exploration to determine the feasibility of their creative idea.</p><p><strong>3.QuaCR Research Fellowship</strong> proposals seek to support talented U.S. citizen graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in the field of quantum information processing (primary interest) and quantum sensing (secondary interest). Applicants with a background from either within or outside QIS are encouraged.

The I-Corps Program utilizes experiential learning of customer and industry discovery, coupled with first-hand investigation of industrial processes, to quickly assess the translational potential of inventions. The I-Corps Program is designed to support the commercialization of "deep technologies,&rdquo; those revolving around fundamental discoveries in science and engineering. The I-Corps Program addresses the skill and knowledge gaps associated with the transformation of basic research into deep technology ventures (DTVs).


The purpose of the I-Corps Teams program is to identify NSF-funded researchers to receive additional support in the form of entrepreneurial education, mentoring, and funding to accelerate the translation of knowledge derived from fundamental research into emerging products and services that may attract subsequent third-party funding. The outcomes of I-Corps Teams' projects are threefold: 1) a decision on a clear path forward based on an assessment of the business model, 2) substantial first-hand evidence for or against product-market fit, with the identification of customer segments and corresponding value propositions, and 3) a narrative of a technology demonstrationfor potential partners.

This funding mechanism is designed to facilitate and promote a PI&rsquo;s ability to effectively adopt empowering technologies that might not be readily accessible in the PI&rsquo;s current research environment or collaboration network.Transformative research likely spans disciplines and minimizing the practical barriers to doing so will strengthen research programs poised to make significant contributions.The award is intended to allow mid-career or later-stage researchers (Associate or Full Professor, or equivalent) to expand or make a transition in their research programs via a sabbatical leave or similar mechanism of professional development and then develop that research program in their own lab. This award will also enable the PI to acquire new scientific or technical expertise, facilitate the investigator&rsquo;s competitiveness, and potentially lead to transformational impacts in molecular and cellular bioscience. The award would fund up to six months of PI salary during the first sabbatical or professional development year, followed by support for continued research for two subsequent years upon the PI&rsquo;s return to normal academic duties. Requests for flexibility in the timing of the sabbatical or professional development year will be considered with appropriate justification. Please contact the cognizant program director for the solicitation. Through this solicitation MCB and NSF hope to develop a novel mechanism that will encourage investigators to expand and/or transition to new research areas aligned with MCB priorities, to increase retention of investigators in science, and to ensure a scientific workforce that remains engaged in active research.


Highest funding priority is given to proposals that have outstanding intellectual merit and broader impacts, while proposals with weaknesses in either category (or those that are perceived as likely to have an incremental impact) will not be competitive.Proposals should also demonstrate a strong record of prior accomplishment, a compelling plan for professional development that will enable the PI to forge a new direction in their scholarship, and a strong rationale for why this support is needed for the PI to become competitive in the new research area. Support for the proposed transition from the PI&rsquo;s department, described in a letter from the department chair or equivalent, will also be required.

<p>Funding Opportunity Title: Low-Cost Chip-Scale Atomic Clock (LC CSAC)</p>
<p>Funding Instrument Type: Technology investment agreement</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The aim of this Special Notice under the ARL BAA (W911NF-17-S-0003), under Grants.gov Opportunity W911NF-17-S-0003-SPECIALNOTICE-LC-CSAC, is to fund a team or multiple teams to design, manufacture, and deliver a battery-powered atomic clock that achieves identical (or better) size, weight, and power (SWaP) and performance to the commercially available chip-scale atomic clock (CSAC) with a selling price goal of &lt; $300/unit in high volume.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Precise timing is critical for numerous Army applications such as navigation, communications, surveillance, and synchronization of sensors and systems. Assured PNT solutions currently rely on acquiring GPS signals, which may not be readily available in increasingly contested environments. Commercially available silicon MEMS and quartz oscillators (TCXO, OCXO) are unable to provide GPS holdover in the event of a GPS outage, except for high-end OCXOs that may be considered large and power hungry for certain applications. To ease reliance on GPS, long-holdover clocks with SWaP-C appropriate for various DoD platforms are necessary to enable mission-critical functions even in contested environments. Current high-performance atomic clocks (maser, laser-cooled cesium fountain) serve as standards and are large, expensive, and require regular monitoring and exquisite environmental control.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the early 2000s, the chip-scale atomic clock (CSAC) has been developed and successfully matured into a commercial product with DARPA and industry investment. While an Army/Air Force/OSD Manufacturing Technology effort further reduced the manufacturing cost1, the current selling price is still prohibitive for high-volume, low-SWaP DoD platforms. There is an opportunity to leverage the many advances in MEMS, photonics, and atomic physics over the past two decades to develop state-of-the-art, high-performance, battery-powered atomic clocks with improved manufacturability, significantly reduced cost, and improved performance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This special notice seeks proposals from one or more for-profit firms in accordance with 32 CFR 37.210.&nbsp;A consortium, led by a for-profit firm, is also encouraged.</p>

More than a decade ago, the National Science Foundation&rsquo;s (NSF) Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) established the Expeditions in Computing (Expeditions) program to build on past successes and provide the CISE research and education community with the opportunity to pursue ambitious, fundamental research agendas that promise to de&#64257;ne the future of computing and information.


In planning Expeditions projects, investigators are strongly encouraged to come together within or across departments or institutions to combine their creative talents in the identi&#64257;cation of compelling, transformative research agendas that look ahead by at least a decade and promise disruptive innovations in computer and information science and engineering for many years to come.


Now funded at levels up to $15,000,000 for seven years, Expeditions projects represent some of the largest single investments currently made by the CISE directorate. Together with the Science and Technology Centers and the National Artificial Intelligence Research Institutes that CISE supports, Expeditions projects form the centerpiece of the directorate's center-scale award portfolio. With awards funded at levels that promote the formation of large research teams, CISE recognizes that concurrent research advances in multiple &#64257;elds or sub-&#64257;elds are often necessary to stimulate deep and enduring outcomes. The awards made in this program will complement research areas supported by other CISE programs, which target particular computer and information science and engineering &#64257;elds.

Here intelligence includes a broad class of methods that enable a robot to solve problems or to make contextually appropriate decisions and act upon them. The program welcomes research that considers inextricably interwoven questions of intelligence, computation, and embodiment. Projects may also focus on a distinct aspect of intelligence, computation, or embodiment, as long as the proposed research is clearly justified in the context of a class of robots.


The focus of the FRR program is on foundational advances in robotics. Robotics is a deeply interdisciplinary field, and proposals are encouraged across the full range of fundamental engineering and computer science research challenges arising in robotics. To be responsive to the FRR program, each proposal should clearly articulate the following three points:

<ol>
<li>The focus of the research project should be a robot or a class of robots, as defined above. [Is there a robot?]</li>

The program supportsresearch addressing learning in individuals and in groups, across a wide range of domains at one or more levels of analysis, including molecular and cellular mechanisms; brain systems; cognitive, affective and behavioral processes; and social and cultural influences.


The program also supports research on augmented intelligence that clearly articulates principled ways in which human approaches to learning and related processes, such as in design, complex decision-making and problem-solving, can be improved through interactions with others or through the use of artificial intelligence in technology. These could include ways of using knowledge about human functioning to improve the design of collaborative technologies that have the capacity to learn to adapt to humans.


For both aspects of the program, there is special interest in collaborative and collective models of learning and intelligence that are supported by the unprecedented speed and scale of technological connectivity.This includes emphasis on how people and technology working together in new ways and at scale can achieve more than either can attain alone. The program also seeks explanations for how the emergent intelligence of groups, organizations and networks intersects with processes of learning, behavior and cognition in individuals. 


Projects that are convergent or interdisciplinary may be especially valuable in advancing basic understanding of these areas, but research within a single discipline or methodology is also appropriate.Connections between proposed research and specific technological, educational and workforce applications will be considered as valuable broader impacts but are not necessarily central to the intellectual merit of proposed research. The program supports a variety of approaches, including experiments, field studies, surveys, computational modeling, and artificial intelligence or machine learning methods.


Examples of general research questions within scope of Science of Learning and Augmented Intelligence (SL)include:

<ul type="disc">
<li>What are the underlying mechanisms that support transfer of learning from one context to another or from one domain to another?How is learning generalized from a small set of specific experiences?What is the basis for robust learning that is resilient against potential interference from new experiences?How is learning consolidated and reconsolidated from transient experience to stable memory?</li>
<li>How do human interactions with technologies, imbued with artificial intelligence, provide improved human task performance?What models best describe the interplay of the individual and collaborative processes that lead to co-creation of knowledge and collective intelligence? In what ways do the capacities and constraints of human cognition inform improved methods of human-artificial intelligence collaboration?</li>
<li>How can we integrate research findings and insights across levels of analysis, relating understanding of cellular and molecular mechanisms of learning in the neurons, to circuit and systems-level computations of learning in the brain, to cognitive, affective, social and behavioral processes of learning? What is the relationship between assembly of new networks (development) and learning new knowledge in a maturing or mature brain? What concepts, tools (including Big Data, machine learning, and other computational models) or questions will provide the most productive linkages across levels of analysis?</li>
<li>How can insights from biological learners contribute and derive new theoretical perspectives to artificial intelligence, neuromorphic engineering, materials science and nanotechnology? How can the ability of biological systems to learn from relatively few examples improve efficiency of artificial systems?How do learning systems (biological and artificial) address complex issues of causal reasoning?How can knowledge about the ways in which humans learn help in the design of human-machine interfaces?</li>

The emphasis within XC is diversity and inclusion, international cooperation, and education (including experiential learning at REU/RET Sites). Additionally, activities that broadly engage the community, such as summer schools, institutes, workshops, and conferences that do not fit within just one or two programs in the Division of Materials Research, may be supported by XC.If preparing a workshop proposal, follow the Special Guidelines for Conference Proposals outlined in the Proposal &amp; Award Policies &amp; Procedures Guide (PAPPG). Occasionally projects crossing several programs in DMR are shifted to XC or co-funded by XC. The goal is to bring greater visibility to these projects through DMR&rsquo;s XC website.


Proposals are welcome that do not fit elsewhere at NSF that are also highly relevant for the materials research and education community. Some XC activities are co-funded with other NSF units. XC does not handle traditional research proposals suitable for submission to topical or other programs in DMR. For this reason, the XC Team welcomes inquiries that include a draft of one-page NSF summary, or a shorter write-up. It is highly recommended that you contact one of the Program Directors for XC prior to submission of a full proposal exceeding $50,000.

The ECI program supports research that advances knowledge on the behavior of physical civil infrastructure subjected to and interacting with the natural environment during construction; under service and long-term conditions, including increased demands due to climate change adaptation and other emerging stressors; and under conditions caused by single or multiple extreme hazard events (extreme weather, windstorms, earthquakes, tsunamis, storm surges, landslides, and fire, including wildland-urban interface fire). The ECI program also supports research on geomaterials and infrastructure materials utilized in load-bearing systems as well as in non-structural systems. Of particular interest is experimental and analytical/computational research to advance the fundamental understanding of coupled multi-physics, multi-scale (spatial and temporal), multi-functional behavior of these materials and their intended use in civil infrastructure.


The ECI program supports research on civil infrastructure that contributes to the National Science Foundation&rsquo;s role in the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP) and the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program (NWIRP). Principal Investigators are encouraged to leverage NSF&rsquo;s investments in the Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) experimental, computational modeling and simulation, and data resources (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?https://www.designsafe-ci.org/">https://www.designsafe-ci.org/</a>) in their research to accelerate advances needed for reducing the impacts of natural hazards on civil infrastructure. The NHERI Science Plan (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?https://www.designsafe-ci.org/facilities/nco/science-plan/">https://www.designsafe-ci.org/facilities/nco/science-plan/</a>) offers a range of research topics that could benefit from the use of NHERI resources and are relevant to the ECI program.


The ECI program does not support research that addresses natural resource exploration or recovery, investigates blasts and explosions, develops sensor and measurement technologies, or focuses on hazard characterization. The ECI program only supports fundamental research topics for civil infrastructure with a strong grounding in theory. Topics which fall within the mission for research and/or development of other federal and state agencies are appropriate for the ECI program only when addressing fundamental scientific questions. Research on natural hazard characterization is supported through programs in the NSF Directorate for Geosciences.


Proposers are actively encouraged to email a one-page project summary to the ECI Program Officers before submitting a full proposal for guidance on whether the proposed research topic falls within the scope of the ECI program; this guidance especially should be requested for multi-disciplinary research proposals, proposals for which research and/or development on the subject civil infrastructure(s) are also supported by other federal and state agencies, and proposals that consider civil infrastructure not listed above.",NULL,7,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,"[{"applicant_type_id": 8, "applicant_type_name": "Unrestricted (i.e., open to any type of entity above), subject to any clarification in text field entitled \"Additional Information on Eligibility\""}]"

The BMMB program supports fundamental and transformative research that advances our understanding of engineering biomechanics and/or mechanobiology. The program emphasizes the study of biological mechanics across multiple domains, from sub-cellular to whole organism. Distinct from conventional engineering materials, the program encourages the consideration of diverse living tissues as smart materials that are self-designing.


BMMB projects must have a clear biological component, a clear mechanics component, and must improve our understanding of the mechanical behavior of a living system. Investigations of the mechanical behavior of biological molecules, cells, tissues, and living systems are welcome. An important concern is the influence of in vivo mechanical forces on cell and matrix biology in the histomorphogenesis, maintenance, regeneration, repair, and aging of tissues and organs. The program is also interested in efforts to translate recent biomechanical and mechanobiological discoveries into engineering science.


Multiscale mechanics approaches are encouraged but not required. Projects may include theoretical, computational, or experimental approaches, or a combination thereof. NSF does not support clinical trials; however, feasibility studies involving human volunteers or animal subjects may be supported if appropriate to the scientific objectives of the project.


Proposals should address the novelty and/or potentially transformative nature of the proposed work compared to previous work in the field. Also, it is essential to address why the proposed work is important in terms of engineering science, and to state the potential impact of success in the research on society and/or industry.


Innovative proposals outside of these specific areas of biomechanics and mechanobiology will be considered. However, prior to submission of particularly unique topics, it is strongly recommended that Principal Investigators (PIs) contact the program director to discuss how the proposed work fits within the scope of the program and avoid the possibility of the proposal being returned without review.


Related programs also fund certain aspects of biomechanics and mechanobiology research, and PIs are encouraged to examine these to find the appropriate program for submission. Proposals with a heavy emphasis on tissue engineering or developing validated models of tissue and organ systems should consider the Engineering of Biomedical Systems (EBMS) program.Projects addressing biological questions about the physiological mechanisms and structural features of organisms should consult the Physiological Mechanisms &amp; Biomechanics (PMB) program.Projects elucidating aspects of neural control may consider the Perception, Action, &amp; Cognition (PAC) program or the Mind, Machine, and Motor Nexus (M3X) program if the project contains work relevant to human-machine interaction. Projects in rehabilitation engineering should consider the Disability and Rehabilitation Engineering (DARE) program. Projects focused on fundamental research related to design, characterization, and modification of biomaterials should consider the Biomaterials (BMAT) program. Manufacturing systems proposals should consider the Advanced Manufacturing (AM) program. Work on the interplay between structure, dynamics, and function of biomolecules without advancing our understanding of the mechanics of a living system should consider the Molecular Biophysics program. Researchers who believe their work may span multiple programs are particularly encouraged to contact the cognizant program directors well in advance of submission.


The duration of unsolicited proposal awards is generally up to three years; proposals for a shorter duration are welcome. Single-investigator award budgets typically include support for one graduate student (or equivalent trainee) and up to one month of PI time per year (awards for multiple investigator projects are typically larger). Proposal budgets or durations that are much larger than typical should be discussed with the program director prior to submission.

The goal of NASA MUSIC is: to provide strategic effort that will leverage research and contract relationships of MSIs and NASA through relationships developed by non-profit organizations that may include collaboration of subject matter experts and access to NASA research facilities; An effort to improve STEM education and research at MSIs; A funded activity that seeks to build institutional capacity of MSIs; An activity to support long-term sustainability of STEM research at MSIs. MUSIC seeks to address the agency goals and objectives through:  Increasing the institutional awareness of NASA competitive resources that can build the capacity of MSIs to offer and conduct STEM undergraduate and graduate research with a focus on NASA opportunities. Assembling MSIs and their stakeholders with common interests, and challenges then provide common tools for MSIs to increase efficiency and optimize resources including opportunities to develop formal and informal partnerships. Connecting MSI administrators and university STEM leaders to cutting-edge initiatives at NASA that can increase interest in securing research and contracting opportunities while supporting NASA’s policy to achieve an Agency-wide goal of providing one percent of total contract value of prime and subcontracting awards to MSIs.     https://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/procurement/regs/1826.htm
To achieve these goals, MUSIC seeks to increase university program capacity about practical uses of research to drive institution sustainability through the following targets:  Advance the understanding of MSIs on how to effectively develop institutional administrative support by competing at the university level for funding opportunities, which will result in successful application to, and management of these funding opportunities (including those at NASA).  Extend MSI’s capabilities by: A.   Leveraging the MSIs research capabilities with NASA research to develop Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) projects that develop and demonstrate innovative technologies that fulfill NASA needs and have significant potential for successful commercialization. B.  Increasing the preparation of undergraduate and graduate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics faculty with opportunities to participate with NASA researchers and missions through grants and contracts. To achieve these goals and objectives, NASA solicits proposals from MSIs to implement the NASA MUSIC; to engage MSIs in authentic STEM experiences related to NASA missions; and to inspire and captivate learners utilizing NASA’s unique assets to develop a keen interest in STEM.

They are of crucial importance for producing goods and services, creating value, providing jobs, and achieving social goals. The Science of Organizations (SoO) program funds basic research that yields a scientific evidence base for improving the design and emergence, development and deployment, and management and ultimate effectiveness of organizations of all kinds. 

SoO funds research that advances our fundamental understanding of how organizations develop, form and operate. Successful SoO research proposals use scientific methods to develop and refine theories, to empirically test theories and frameworks, and to develop new measures and methods. Funded research is aimed at yielding generalizable insights that are of value to the business practitioner, policy-maker and research communities. 

SoO welcomes any and all rigorous, scientific approaches that illuminate aspects of organizations as systems of coordination, management and governance. 

In considering whether a particular project might be a candidate for consideration by SoO, please note: 
<ul><li><div>Intellectual perspectives may involve (but are not limited to) organizational theory, behavior, sociology or economics, business policy and strategy, communication sciences, entrepreneurship, human resource management, information sciences, managerial and organizational cognition, operations management, public administration, social or industrial psychology, and technology and innovation management. </div></li><li><div>Phenomena studied may include (but are not limited to) structures, routines, effectiveness, competitiveness, innovation, dynamics, change and evolution.</div></li><li>Levels of analysis may include (but are not limited to) organizational, cross-organizational collaborations or relationships, and institutional and can address individuals, groups or teams.</li><li>Research methods may be qualitative and quantitative and may include (but are not limited to) archival analyses, surveys, simulation studies, experiments, comparative case studies, and network analyses. </li></ul>
Consistent with NSF merit review criteria, each SoO proposal should discuss both the intellectual merit and the potential broader impacts of the proposed research. SoO values basic research that has the potential to provide broader societal benefits. However, the majority of space in any proposal will need to be dedicated to the explication of theory, methods, and specific contribution to the evidence base about organizational effectiveness.

Projects that aim to implement and subsequently evaluate particular organizational training, effectiveness or change programs, rather than to advance fundamental, generalizable knowledge, are not appropriate for SoO.

NOAA advances scientific and technical programs to help society cope with, and adapt to, today's variations in climate and to prepare for tomorrow's.  Toward this end, the agency conducts and supports climate research, observations, modeling, information management, assessments, interdisciplinary decision support research, outreach, education, and stakeholder partnership development.  These investments are key to NOAA's mission of "Science, Service, and Stewardship" and are guided by the agency's vision to create and sustain enhanced resilience in ecosystems, communities, and economies, as described in NOAA's Next Generation Strategic Plan (NGSP) .   Fostering climate adaptation and mitigation, and, specifically, the development of an informed society anticipating and responding to climate and its impacts - is one of the primary pathways through which NOAA plans to advance its mission. The NGSP outlines NOAA's five-year climate objectives: 1) Improved scientific understanding of the changing climate system and its impacts; 2) Assessments of current and future states of the climate system that identify potential impacts and inform science, service, and stewardship decisions; 3) Mitigation and adaptation choices supported by sustained, reliable, and timely climate services; and 4) A climate-literate public that understands its vulnerabilities to a changing climate and makes informed decisions. NOAA works in partnership with Federal, academic, private, and international research entities, and places a substantial emphasis on productive partnerships and interactions with decision makers and other stakeholders.Within this context, NOAA's Climate Program Office (CPO) manages competitive research programs conducted in regions across the United States, at national and international scales, and globally. The CPO also provides strategic guidance and oversight for the agency's climate science and services programs and helps to integrate capabilities from across the agency to provide enhanced services to its constituents. Achieving the first of the NGSP climate objectives, an improved scientific understanding of the changing climate system and its impacts, requires a number of core capabilities be supported.  These core capabilities can be broadly categorized to include: (a) understanding and modeling, (b) observing systems, data stewardship, and climate monitoring, (c) predictions and projections, and (d) integrated service development and decision support.These core capabilities, in turn, will focus initially on the following societal challenges identified in the NGSP as early evidence of progress to be made by NOAA in providing sustained, reliable, and timely climate services:*      Climate Impacts on Water Resources*     Coasts and Climate Resilience*     Sustainability of Marine Ecosystems*     Changes in Extremes of Weather and Climate*     Information for Mitigating Climate ChangeEach of the Competitions announced in this Federal Funding Opportunity addresses one or more of these core capabilities or societal challenges.  It is expected that applications submitted in response to this Opportunity will identify their relevance to NOAA's climate science and services by indicating which core capabilities and/or societal challenges will be addressed by the proposed work.  Application abstracts must include a paragraph describing the work's relevance to the NGSP's long-term goal of climate adaptation and mitigation as well as to the Competition that is being targeted.In FY 2012, we estimate that $15.5 million will be available for approximately 60 new awards pending budget appropriations.   It is anticipated that most awards will be at a funding level between $50,000 and $200,000 per year, with some exceptions for larger awards.

Note: Proposals may be returned without review if the primary goal of the research is to understand (1) structure/function mappings between PAC processes and neural activity; (2) clinical populations per se; or (3) behavior of non-human animals without a clear and direct impact on our understanding of human perception, action or cognition. Before submitting a proposal, investigators are encouraged to email <a href="mailto:sbe-pac@nsf.gov">sbe-pac@nsf.gov</a> with a one-page summary of the proposed research (modeled after the Project Summary page of a standard proposal and including a description of both Intellectual Merit and Broader Impacts) in order to confirm appropriateness of the work for the PAC program.


PIs are strongly encouraged to submit the Single Copy Document titled &ldquo;List of Suggested Reviewers&rdquo; with their full proposal. Sharing of data and other materials is an expectation for funded research. Please consult the NSF<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2019/nsf19069/nsf19069.jsp">Dear Colleague Letter: Effective Practices for Data</a> for more details.

The intent of DCC-PGR awards is to support collaborative research linking US researchers with partners from developing countries to solve problems of mutual interest in agriculture, energy and the environment, while placing US and international researchers at the center of a global network of scientific excellence. The long-term goal of these collaborative research efforts is a greater and sustained engagement with developing countries in plant biotechnology research. In order to realize the full potential of biotechnology for the developing world, the technology must target crops grown locally in the developing countries and the traits that are most relevant to the local farmers and consumers. At the same time, proposals should meet the broad goals of the PGRP described in the current Program Solicitation.  Of special interest are those research projects that build on prior PGRP investments and that tackle problems specific to crops grown in the developing world. A request for supplemental funding should be made under an existing PGRP award.  Support can also be requested within a proposal for a new or renewal PGRP award.  Proposed collaborative activities are encouraged that focus on research problems important to developing countries and that include scientist-to-scientist interactions potentially leading to long-term partnerships among participating laboratories. The exchange of ideas and people should be reciprocal and should be built on equal partnerships among U.S. scientists and scientists of developing nations.  Examples of activities to be supported would include, but not be limited to: joint research projects; and long-term (1 year) or short-term (1-3 months) exchange visits that are reciprocal exchanges of investigators and students between the US and developing countries. Collaborations should be developed that bring complementary sets of expertise to bear on problems of importance to the participants from developing countries, and that meet their identified needs.",NULL,7,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,"[{"applicant_type_id": 8, "applicant_type_name": "Unrestricted (i.e., open to any type of entity above), subject to any clarification in text field entitled \"Additional Information on Eligibility\""}]"

The overarching goal for the Accelerating Research Translation (ART) program is to advance the U.S. scientific and economic leadership by building capacity and increasing the number of robust translational research ecosystems in Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs) that span across the full geography of our nation.&#8239;Innovations can occur anywhere and can be opportunities for creating sustained impacts in every single region of the United States. Achieving translational outcomes as a mechanism to drive sustained economic impacts is the primary aim of the "Accelerating Research Translation" (ART) program. <a id="_anchor_1" name="_msoanchor_1" href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?file:///C:/Users/hmehta/Desktop/ART%20Solicitation%20final/ART%2003-24-2025/ART%20solicitation_gln_pf%20clean%20document.docx#_msocom_1"></a>


 


Led by NSFs Directorate for Technology, Innovation and Partnerships (TIP) and in collaboration with other NSF directorates and the Office of Integrative Activities, the ART program seeks proposals involving institutional leadership; research translation programs, institutes or centers; technology transfer offices; units responsible for managing research intellectual property (IP); entrepreneurial training teams; and researchers from all scientific, technological and engineering fields in collaboration with one or more of the other target categories mentioned below.  This updated ART solicitation expands and builds upon its previous version, <a href="https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/art-accelerating-research-translation/nsf23-558/solicitation">NSF 23-558</a>, by implementing Tracks that address varying stages of capacity to accelerate research translation.


  


The ART program is aimed at providing resources that will ultimately facilitate a wide range of IHEs to achieve research translation, accelerate technology transfer, and create sustained economic and collective impacts across the U.S. It is understood that, like technology readiness levels (TRLs), there is no one measure or a combination of measures that can be used to describe the capacity of or measure the research translation readiness level (RTRL) for an IHE.  Some indicators that reflect on RTRL include volume of sustained basic and applied research as measured by research expenditures, robust technology transfer and entrepreneurship related activities (e.g. invention disclosures, patents, licenses, royalties, partnerships with industry, non-profits etc.).  Number of start-ups, resources for entrepreneurial and innovation education and training, the presence of a dedicated technology transfer office are also some of the other indicators that reflect on the RTRL.


 


Some of the criteria that may help identify the RTRL for an IHE are shown in Figure 1.  Typically, an IHE with low RTRL is likely to have very few patent, licensing, or start-ups related activities, while as these activities will be at a higher level for an IHE with a medium RTRL, whereas an IHE with high RTRL would likely have established tech transfer office with an an extensive record of technology transfer activities including patenting, licensing and creation of  startups, as well as extensive education, training, networking opportunities related to tech transfer and entrepreneurship. For the purpose of this solicitation, the illustration below provides some descriptors that may be useful in deciding which Track may be the best fit for a proposing organization. It is ultimately up to a proposing organization to determine which Track may present the best alignment for their submission.

The ART program seeks proposals that have a blend of: (1) activities that will help build and/or strengthen the institutional infrastructure to sustainably grow the institutional capacity for research translation in the short and long terms; (2) educational/training opportunities, especially in engaged scholarship and experiential opportunities for students, postdoctoral researchers, and faculty, to become entrepreneurial leads (EL) and/or seek use-inspired- and/or technology transfer- and research translation-oriented careers in the public and/or private sectors; and (3) specific, research translation and technology transfer activities that offer immediate opportunities for transition to practice to create sustained economic and collective impacts. Importantly, NSFs definitions of research translation and technology transfer go beyond a traditional focus on lab-to-market pathways leading to new startups and small businesses; rather, NSF aims to grow capacity at IHEs to achieve the full range of translational impacts emanating from research discoveries and innovations by including civic entrepreneurship; informing standards-setting, policy, and regulatory bodies; scaling rigorous and engaging curricula, instructional material, and pedagogies; and more.


 


The ART program framework is built around five distinct Tracks that are interconnected. These Tracks are differentiated by the RTRL. Track 1 is designed and intended for IHEs that currently have a low to medium RTRL. The IHEs responding to Track 1 are expected to have on-going research that has potential and opportunity for innovation translation but the infrastructure and the ecosystem for creating such opportunities for research translation are very limited.  On the other hand, Track 2 is designed and intended for IHEs with some modest infrastructure and ecosystem that has a high volume of research but overall low level of research translation. Tracks 3 and 4 are designed and intended for IHEs or non-profits that have a significantly higher RTRL (or equivalent experience) and can create and deliver entrepreneurship-, technology transfer related education and training materials and offer related services to IHEs that have a much lower RTRL. Track 5 is designed and intended for providing support to an IHE that can coordinate research translation-related activities for teams across all the other Tracks.  


 


Track 1: Accelerating Technology Transfer (ACT)  

<ul type="disc">
<li>This is an opportunity for only IHEs that have a low to medium level of overall research and can demonstrate potential for identifying and acting on opportunities for economic benefits by starting to build capacity for innovation translation. A Track 1 award is expected to be up to a total of $3 million for a duration of 3 years. The proposal must be led by and focused on outcomes of one IHE. Subject to availability of funds and quality of proposals, NSF plans to make up to 20 awards under the ACT Track. ACT awardees demonstrating strong performance, as demonstrated by successfully meeting evaluation criteria during the award may have an opportunity to receive renewal support for up to 2 more years and total funding up to $1 million, subject to the availability of funds.</li>
</ul>

Track 2: Growing Capacity for Research Translation (GROW)   

<ul type="disc">
<li>This is an opportunity for only IHEs that currently have a high level of research with a modest research translation infrastructure in place but where the level of research translation remains relatively low. This Track 2 is aimed at IHEs that have a high potential and desire to substantially elevate the overall level of research translation to unleash innovation and create significant opportunities for sustained economic and collective impacts. The proposal must be led by and focused on outcomes of one IHE in partnership with one mentoring IHE with a high RTRL. A Track 2 award may be budgeted for up to a total of $6 million for a duration of 4 years. Subject to availability of funds and quality of proposals, NSF plans to make up to 10 awards under this Track.   </li>
</ul>

 Track 3: Technology Transfer Resource Centers (RESOURCE)   

<ul type="disc">
<li>The ART program aims to leverage the experience and resources of IHEs or non-profits with strong research translation capacity (and/or experience) to launch a network of regional Technology Transfer Resource Centers (RESOURCE) that promote regional technology transfer and technology development activities available to multiple IHEs in a region with low or emerging research capacity and little or no dedicated technology transfer or research translation resources.  A Track 3 award for a RESOURCE is expected to provide guidance, training, education, and services to other IHEs in a region who have a low RTRL. A Track 3 award is expected to be up to a total of $8 million for a duration of 4 years. Subject to availability of funds and quality of proposals, NSF plans to make up to 5 RESOURCE awards. Some awardees demonstrating strong performance, as demonstrated by successfully meeting evaluation criteria during the award, including progress toward self-sustainability, may have an opportunity to receive renewal support for up to 4 more years and additional funding of up to $2 million, subject to the availability of funds. As noted above, the lead IHE for this Track is expected to be an IHE with a very high RTRL or a non-profit with significant expertise related to technology transfer, entrepreneurship and related areas leading to sustained economic impacts.      </li>
</ul>

 Track 4: Education and Training (ET)    

<ul type="disc">
<li>

This nationally focused Track invites proposals from IHEs or non-profits with any combination of either a strong, vibrant and established research translation ecosystem, and/or demonstrated experience to develop, evaluate, and deploy educational and training resources related to entrepreneurship, technology transfer and related activities. The beneficiaries for these education and training resources to be developed will be lower RTRL IHEs located anywhere in the United States (including but not limited to Track 1 and Track 2 awardees). Track 4 awards may be budgeted up to a total of $3 million for a duration of 3 years. Subject to availability of funds and quality of proposals, NSF plans to make up to 4 ET awards. Some awardees demonstrating strong performance, as demonstrated by successfully meeting evaluation criteria during the award, including progress toward self-sustainability, may have an opportunity to receive renewal support for up to 2 more years and additional funding up to $2 million (subject to the availability of funds), to scale up the deployment and adoption of the developed resources and training materials nationally.

</li>
</ul>

Track 5: Coordinating Accelerating Research Translation (CART) 

<ul type="disc">
<li>This Track invites proposals from IHEs or non-profits for the creation of a unifying center that will facilitate the development of an integrated platform for coordinating, evaluating, and monitoring the progress being made by teams that are supported under both Tracks 1 and 2. The CART awardee would also coordinate activities to be carried out under awards pursuant to Tracks 3 and 4. The Track 5 CART cooperative agreement award may be budgeted up to a total of $3 million for a duration of 5 years. Subject to availability of funds and quality of proposals, NSF plans to make up to 2 awards under the CART Track. Some awardees demonstrating strong performance, as demonstrated by successfully meeting evaluation criteria during the award, including progress toward self-sustainability, may have an opportunity to receive renewal for up to 5 more years and additional funding up to $3 million, subject to the availability of funds. Proposals for this Track must be led by one IHE with a high RTRL with significant expertise and experience in areas related to technology transfer, intellectual property management, entrepreneurship as well as initiatives and programs directed at sustained economic and collective impacts. </li>

The translation of research to practice ensures that the insights and innovations developed through scientific study and experimentation have tangible, positive impacts for the Nation. These impacts include improving the quality of life, promoting economic and job growth, ensuring national security, and maintaining global competitiveness. Indeed, scientific and engineering breakthroughs have the potential to address critical societal challenges in industries such as aerospace, agriculture, communications, education, energy, healthcare, national security, and transportation &ndash; but the translation of discoveries and innovations from the laboratory to society often takes many forms including non-linear pathways.


The NSF TTP program was developed with several goals in mind:

<ul>
<li>To identify and support use-inspired research and translational activities enabling a continuum from foundational research to practice;</li>
<li>To develop partnerships and collaborations between institutions of higher education and other entities (e.g., industry, state/local/national government agencies, philanthropies, open-source ecosystems, for-benefit, for-profit and non-profit organizations, international organizations, etc.);</li>
<li>To promote and advance the education and training of students and postdoctoral researchers, encouraging the participation of all Americans in STEM including innovation and entrepreneurship; and</li>
<li>To identify future customer needs and opportunities and bring these to the forefront in the conduct of use-inspired research and translational activities.</li>
</ul>

The NSF TTP program offers three tracks that represent different starting points or stages in moving discoveries and innovations from the laboratory to practice:

<ul>
<li>NSF TTP-Explore (NSF TTP-E) is a pilot track that is likely to be the first step for researchers seeking to translate their basic research to practice. To be eligible for the NSF TTP-E track, proposers must have an active, eligible, NSF research award (see Eligibility Information for further details). TTP-E is designed to encourage current, eligible NSF awardees to intentionally pursue applications of their research with the potential for societal impact. The NSF TTP-E track provides the opportunity to obtain an extension of the initial award period of a current NSF award for up to two years in order to offer investigators an opportunity to explore adventurous, high-risk, use-inspired research and initial translational activities as the starting point for translation that was not covered by the original research award.</li>
<li>NSF TTP-Translate (NSF TTP-T) starts with use-inspired research and initial translational activities and further matures the idea(s), iterates and improves the solution(s), and lowers the barrier(s) to effective translation of research from lab to practice.</li>
<li>NSF TTP-Partner (NSF TTP-P) supports translational efforts that demand one or more partnerships for technology development and deployment. Here, strategic partnerships with stakeholders beyond U.S. institutions of higher education are essential ingredients for success and may include industry partners, government entities at all levels, philanthropies, international organizations, or other groups associated with large scale productization and distribution. The NSF TTP-P track requires an NSF-Catalyzed Partnership with an organization that will assist in the translation to practice. In addition to the Principal Investigator (PI), NSF TTP-P proposals must include a co-PI or Senior/Key Personnel who is a member or employee of the NSF-Catalyzed Partner. Partnerships with U.S. institutions of higher education are valued, but NSF TTP strongly prioritizes NSF-Catalyzed Partnerships that are able to help bring the product, process, or service to the market, potentially through licensing agreements, startup or small business formation, incorporation into an existing open-source ecosystem, development into standards setting arrangements, etc.</li>

Agency Overview:

The Advanced Research Projects Agency – Energy (ARPA-E), an organization within the Department of Energy (DOE), is chartered by Congress in the America COMPETES Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-69), as amended by the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-358), as further amended by the Energy Act of 2020 (P.L. 116-260):
“(A) to enhance the economic and energy security of the United States through the development of energy technologies that—
(i) reduce imports of energy from foreign sources;
(ii) reduce energy-related emissions, including greenhouse gases;
(iii) improve the energy efficiency of all economic sectors; 
(iv) provide transformative solutions to improve the management, clean-up, and disposal of radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel; and
(v) improve the resilience, reliability, and security of infrastructure to produce, deliver, and store energy; and
(B) to ensure that the United States maintains a technological lead in developing and deploying advanced energy technologies.”

ARPA-E issues this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) under its authorizing statute codified at 42 U.S.C. § 16538. The NOFO and any cooperative agreements or grants made under this NOFO are subject to 2 C.F.R. Part 200 as supplemented by 2 C.F.R. Part 910.
	
ARPA-E funds research on, and the development of, transformative science and technology solutions to address the energy and environmental missions of the Department. The agency focuses on technologies that can be meaningfully advanced with a modest investment over a defined period of time in order to catalyze the translation from scientific discovery to early-stage technology. For the latest news and information about ARPA-E, its programs and the research projects currently supported, see: http://arpa-e.energy.gov/.

ARPA-E funds transformational research. Existing energy technologies generally progress on established “learning curves” where refinements to a technology and the economies of scale that accrue as manufacturing and distribution develop drive improvements to the cost/performance metric in a gradual fashion. This continual improvement of a technology is important to its increased commercial deployment and is appropriately the focus of the private sector or the applied technology offices within DOE. In contrast, ARPA-E supports transformative research that has the potential to create fundamentally new learning curves. ARPA-E technology projects typically start with cost/performance estimates well above the level of an incumbent technology. Given the high risk inherent in these projects, many will fail to progress, but some may succeed in generating a new learning curve with a projected cost/performance metric that is significantly better than that of the incumbent technology. ARPA-E will provide support at the highest funding level only for submissions with significant technology risk, aggressive timetables, and careful management and mitigation of the associated risks.

ARPA-E funds technology with the potential to be disruptive in the marketplace. The mere creation of a new learning curve does not ensure market penetration. Rather, the ultimate value of a technology is determined by the marketplace, and impactful technologies ultimately become disruptive – that is, they are widely adopted and displace existing technologies from the marketplace or create entirely new markets. ARPA-E understands that definitive proof of market disruption takes time, particularly for energy technologies. Therefore, ARPA-E funds the development of technologies that, if technically successful, have clear disruptive potential, e.g., by demonstrating capability for manufacturing at competitive cost and deployment at scale. 

 ARPA-E funds applied research and development (R&D). The Office of Management and Budget defines “applied research” as an “original investigation undertaken in order to acquire new knowledge…directed primarily towards a specific practical aim or objective” and defines “experimental development” as “creative and systematic work, drawing on knowledge gained from research and practical experience, which is directed at producing new products or processes or improving existing products or processes.”

Applicants interested in receiving financial assistance for basic research (defined by the Office of Management and Budget as “experimental or theoretical work undertaken primarily to acquire new knowledge of the underlying foundations of phenomena and observable facts”) should contact the DOE’s Office of Science (http://science.energy.gov/). Office of Science national scientific user facilities (http://science.energy.gov/user-facilities/) are open to all researchers, including ARPA-E Applicants and awardees. These facilities provide advanced tools of modern science including accelerators, colliders, supercomputers, light sources and neutron sources, as well as facilities for studying the nanoworld, the environment, and the atmosphere. Projects focused on early-stage R&D for the improvement of technology along defined roadmaps may be more appropriate for support through the DOE applied energy offices including: the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (http://www.eere.energy.gov/), the Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management (https://www.energy.gov/fecm/office-fossil-energy-and-carbon-management), the Office of Nuclear Energy (http://www.energy.gov/ne/office-nuclear-energy), and the Office of Electricity (https://www.energy.gov/oe/office-electricity).

ARPA-E encourages submissions stemming from ideas that still require proof-of-concept R&D efforts as well as those for which some proof-of-concept demonstration already exists. Submissions can propose a project with the end deliverable being an extremely creative, but partial solution.

Program Overview:

The Stimulate Utilization of Plentiful Energy in Rocks through High-temperature Original Technologies (SUPERHOT) program aims to boost baseload power supply by enabling future power production from superhot geothermal resources, defined as temperatures greater than 375 °C and pressures greater than 22 megapascals (MPa). As the demand for power in the U.S. increases, driven by the rise in data centers and increasing electrification, superhot geothermal power can play an important role in addressing this critical need. The amount of energy in the Earth’s subsurface is immense, with estimates of at least 15,000 gigawatts (GW) of producible electricity from depths of at most 10 kilometers (km) within the U.S. alone. Unfortunately, access to this resource has been constrained by the limited extent of natural hydrothermal systems, which currently only provide about 4 GW of utility-scale power.

Expansion beyond natural hydrothermal systems is now possible by recent advances in Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) and in Advanced Geothermal Systems (AGS), which essentially create artificial geothermal reservoirs. The combination of highly productive superhot wells with the expanded geographic availability provided by EGS or AGS technology can accelerate the widespread development of gigawatt-scale geothermal facilities across much of the U.S., with the possibility of 10-20 GW of baseload power with a levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) less than $30 per megawatt hour (MWh) by 2040.

The goal of the SUPERHOT program is to support research and development of new technologies to enable scalable superhot geothermal by addressing the major technical challenges affecting geothermal well life and the ability to harvest subsurface energy effectively. Consequently, the focus is on the following subject areas: 1) robust well construction, and 2) transfer of heat from the surrounding geologic formation to the well.

Agency Overview:
The Advanced Research Projects Agency – Energy (ARPA-E), an organization within the Department of Energy (DOE), is chartered by Congress in the America COMPETES Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-69), as amended by the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-358), as further amended by the Energy Act of 2020 (P.L. 116-260):
“(A) to enhance the economic and energy security of the United States through the development of energy technologies that—
(i) reduce imports of energy from foreign sources;
(ii) reduce energy-related emissions, including greenhouse gases;
(iii) improve the energy efficiency of all economic sectors; 
(iv) provide transformative solutions to improve the management, clean-up, and disposal of radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel; and
(v) improve the resilience, reliability, and security of infrastructure to produce, deliver, and store energy; and
(B) to ensure that the United States maintains a technological lead in developing and deploying advanced energy technologies.”
ARPA-E issues this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) under its authorizing statute codified at 42 U.S.C. § 16538. The NOFO and any cooperative agreements or grants made under this NOFO are subject to 2 C.F.R. Part 200 as supplemented by 2 C.F.R. Part 910.
ARPA-E funds research on, and the development of, transformative science and technology solutions to address the energy and environmental missions of the Department. The agency focuses on technologies that can be meaningfully advanced with a modest investment over a defined period of time in order to catalyze the translation from scientific discovery to early-stage technology. For the latest news and information about ARPA-E, its programs and the research projects currently supported, see: http://arpa-e.energy.gov/.

ARPA-E funds transformational research. Existing energy technologies generally progress on established “learning curves” where refinements to a technology and the economies of scale that accrue as manufacturing and distribution develop drive improvements to the cost/performance metric in a gradual fashion. This continual improvement of a technology is important to its increased commercial deployment and is appropriately the focus of the private sector or the applied technology offices within DOE. In contrast, ARPA-E supports transformative research that has the potential to create fundamentally new learning curves. ARPA-E technology projects typically start with cost/performance estimates well above the level of an incumbent technology. Given the high risk inherent in these projects, many will fail to progress, but some may succeed in generating a new learning curve with a projected cost/performance metric that is significantly better than that of the incumbent technology. ARPA-E will provide support at the highest funding level only for submissions with significant technology risk, aggressive timetables, and careful management and mitigation of the associated risks.
ARPA-E funds technology with the potential to be disruptive in the marketplace. The mere creation of a new learning curve does not ensure market penetration. Rather, the ultimate value of a technology is determined by the marketplace, and impactful technologies ultimately become disruptive – that is, they are widely adopted and displace existing technologies from the marketplace or create entirely new markets. ARPA-E understands that definitive proof of market disruption takes time, particularly for energy technologies. Therefore, ARPA-E funds the development of technologies that, if technically successful, have clear disruptive potential, e.g., by demonstrating capability for manufacturing at competitive cost and deployment at scale. 
 ARPA-E funds applied research and development (R&D). The Office of Management and Budget defines “applied research” as an “original investigation undertaken in order to acquire new knowledge…directed primarily towards a specific practical aim or objective” and defines “experimental development” as “creative and systematic work, drawing on knowledge gained from research and practical experience, which is directed at producing new products or processes or improving existing products or processes.”
Applicants interested in receiving financial assistance for basic research (defined by the Office of Management and Budget as “experimental or theoretical work undertaken primarily to acquire new knowledge of the underlying foundations of phenomena and observable facts”) should contact the DOE’s Office of Science (http://science.energy.gov/). Office of Science national scientific user facilities (http://science.energy.gov/user-facilities/) are open to all researchers, including ARPA-E Applicants and awardees. These facilities provide advanced tools of modern science including accelerators, colliders, supercomputers, light sources and neutron sources, as well as facilities for studying the nanoworld, the environment, and the atmosphere. Projects focused on early-stage R&D for the improvement of technology along defined roadmaps may be more appropriate for support through the DOE applied energy offices including: the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (http://www.eere.energy.gov/), the Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management (https://www.energy.gov/fecm/office-fossil-energy-and-carbon-management), the Office of Nuclear Energy (http://www.energy.gov/ne/office-nuclear-energy), and the Office of Electricity (https://www.energy.gov/oe/office-electricity).

ARPA-E encourages submissions stemming from ideas that still require proof-of-concept R&D efforts as well as those for which some proof-of-concept demonstration already exists. Submissions can propose a project with the end deliverable being an extremely creative, but partial solution.
Program Overview:
1.	SUMMARY
The Catalytic Application Testing for Accelerated Learning Chemistries via High-throughput Experimentation and Modeling Efficiently (CATALCHEM-E) program aims to disrupt and accelerate the design and development cycle for heterogeneous catalyst R&D workflows. The program will span from rational material discovery to synthesis and final reactor testing. These novel workflows will be developed by coupling the latest advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) with high-throughput experimentation (HTE) to verifiably complete 10–15 years of traditional catalysis R&D work within 12–18 months, thus achieving more than a ten-time acceleration in the catalyst development cycle.  The program will then use these new tools to discover and optimize catalytic chemistries relevant to ARPA-E’s goals. These new chemistries will ultimately help advance the objective of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.  
Innovations developed under the CATALCHEM-E program will involve: 
•	Future refinery relevant or other next-generation feedstocks such as hydrogen (H2), nitrogen (N2), oxygen (O2), water (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), ammonia (NH3), methanol (MeOH), ethanol (EtOH), bio-intermediates (CxHyOz), waste plastics, and triglycerides (TAGs); and 
•	Products like ethylene (C2=) and propylene (C3=) as low carbon monomers, and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), diesel, and syngas as distillate range hydrocarbons. 
Key program elements include, but are not limited to: 
•	Novel workflow topologies: A workflow topology is a diagram designating key task nodes involved in the development of a technical catalyst from conception through reactor-scale testing. An example of a traditional, non-automated closed-loop workflow spanning from hypothesis to technical catalyst performance testing is illustrated in Figure 1. The CATALCHEM-E program envisions creating novel closed-loop workflow topologies that strategically remove bottlenecks and time-consuming tasks ultimately resulting in significant acceleration when compared to the traditional workflow.
•	Enhanced data integrity and benchmarking through reference chemistries: The program will use reference chemistries for workflow validation. These reference chemistries have been proven at the commercial scale and are relevant to both ARPA-E’s goals and the U.S. goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Specifically, the reference chemistries recommended in this program have been selected to provide applicants with feedstock phase flexibility across thermochemical and electrochemical reaction classes. Here, commercially available catalysts operating in real-world industrial-scale reactor units will serve as controls to ensure data integrity within each task node in the workflow, and as benchmarks when assessing the performance of AI/ML models.
•	High-quality data generation via HTE: Autonomous or automated HTE methods are necessary to generate high-quality experimental data in large quantities to train and validate AI/ML models. HTE techniques operating over complex, wide parameter spaces can increase the efficiency of experimentation across all stages of the catalyst development cycle, from research catalyst (synthesis, characterization, and validation) to technical catalyst (formulation, characterization, and validation). In addition, the quality of data and ability to identify the most optimal experimental conditions is expected to be enhanced dramatically with these approaches. 
•	AI/ML-ready catalysis databases and informatics: As a result of creating effective CATALCHEM-E workflows, projects must create a set of robust databases in tandem populated with high-quality, multi-scale, multi-modal data as generated and gathered from synthesis, characterization, and performance testing tasks at the ab initio and research and technical catalyst levels. Further, these novel workflows will take advantage of the tools for automation and database management to streamline the storage, access, and processing of collected data that is findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) to accomplish AI/ML tasks.    
•	Transformational multi-scale, multi-modal modeling using AI/ML: As shown in Figure 2 in Section I.C, there are several ways to leverage the AI/ML tools and techniques to understand heterogenous catalyst surfaces starting from known theoretical predictions or prior knowledge in literature coupled with CATALCHEM-E workflow data (including language) from synthesis, advanced characterization, and reactor-scale testing activities. 
•	Surrogate AI/ML assisted computational modeling and simulations: ML-based surrogate models can be used in two ways in the program. First, these models can accelerate the parametric testing space for the reactor-scale performance. Projects may accelerate the simulation of technical catalyst performance at engineering-scale by training surrogate models on data generated using various computational fluid dynamics and multi-physics approaches (e.g., COMSOL, Ansys, and OpenFOAM). , ,  These simulations can be used to expand the training set of the CATALCHEM-E learning model.  Second, these models can accelerate the elucidation of fundamental reaction mechanisms and networks by including atomic scale, ab initio approximations along with microkinetic modeling for more rigorous calculations involving surface transition states and adsorption energetics.
